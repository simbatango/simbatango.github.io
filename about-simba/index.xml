      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/simba-blogging.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A tango dancer since &lt;sup&gt;1998&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;1999&lt;/sub&gt;, I have been consumed by learning, dancing, teaching and djing as well as community building in my small tango community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always thinking a lot about the tango and why it means so much to me, but not always time to write or discuss with the equally tango crazy, I have had the intention to blog for some time, but after I became a father quite recently, there is much less time for dancing, but some time for Â blogging in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is pseudo-anonymous; if you know me, you will probably easily guess who I am, but I ask you to use the nick Simba to my real name nevertheless. Comments are most welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
