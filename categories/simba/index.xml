      <description>It is exactly 10 years since I first put a hesitating foot on a festival dance floor today. So I thought it would be fun to refresh my memories and reflect a bit on where I was then, and what I still keep from that time.
We were just entering the local tango scene, and didn&amp;rsquo;t really know anything about tango at all. We had seen Carlos Saura&amp;rsquo;s Tango, maybe Sally Potter&amp;rsquo;s Tango Lesson, but probably not yet at that time.</description>

Time to upgrade my deejaying slogan. While I still sort of like the tongue in cheek fluffy deejay advertisment in-joke of **Keine komische Musik, **it has several problems. It is in German, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really translate well. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure people get the joke, they may not even understand German. Also it may come off a bit negative. I would prefer a more positive note, so to speak.</description>

How could Simba not like a workshop that started by working with bringing out your inner lion? Not the little cute one, but the grown up, strong one?
The day started rather low, though. &amp;ndash;I am not feeling well, and I had been looking forward to this for so long. La princesa went straight back to bed and needed to stay there, it seemed. I was taking our little guy to his arts class, and she would go to the women&amp;rsquo;s technique class with Graciela.</description>

      <description>Look what Simba got for Father&amp;rsquo;s Day! Guess which is now the favourite book for the night-time reading? Even beats That&amp;rsquo;s not my Dinosaur. The daddy frog and the froglet seems to be my son&amp;rsquo;s favourite part of this book, though.
The book is by Anne Gutman and Georg Hallensleben, published by chronicle books.</description>

Simba.. is trapped in a cage. Yes, he has youtube, he has his music collection. But something is missing. Grrrrrrr.
Will someone please take Simba for a walk. A Di Sarli walk. Or if that&amp;rsquo;s not possible, maybe some comforting words&amp;hellip;</description>
