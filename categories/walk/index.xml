      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/heel-first-toe-first-e1266332407571.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/heel-first-toe-first-e1266332407571.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will not, of course, settle the agelong debate of whether to walk toe first or heel first in tango. Still, I found it interesting that there has recently been  published research on the efficiency of the human walk, specifically investigating walking heel first versus walking toe first.  If you are striving for the most efficient walk, their conclusion might be worth noting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; When human subjects walked with their heels slightly elevated in a ‘low-digitigrade’[toe first] posture, COT [cost of transport] increased by 53% above that of normal plantigrade [heel first] walking.
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; Cunningham, C. B., Schilling, N., Anders, C. andCarrier, D. R. (2010).
[The influence of foot posture onthe cost of transport in humans](http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/213/5/790?ijkey=ce57e4d265e26213e5a9717dc550495b1e75a6c9).
J. Exp. Biol. 213, 790-797
&gt; 
&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers were wondering why we are not walking and running toe first like many other animals and wanted to test the hypothesis that walking heel first is more efficient. They did experiments with different walks and runs on a treadmill where they could measure the oxygen consumption of their subjects at normal walking speed. They also did experiments with running subjects, where this difference does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the reasons for the increased efficiency of walking heel first are (p. 796):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;lower collisional losses of the body as a whole&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;increased recovery of kinetic and potential energy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;lower ground reaction force moments specifically at the ankle joint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not very surprising, maybe, to anyone who has tried both ways, but now you&amp;rsquo;ve got the reference :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their paper says nothing about style, of course&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you prefer your naïve, pure emotional interpretation of the tango, you might not want to read this. If, on the other hand you think that knowing a little about how tango music is organized might increase the breadth or depth of your musical appreciation, then this could be for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&#34;http://tangocommuter1.blogspot.com/2009/08/three-minute-question.html&#34;&gt;Tangocommuter writes&lt;/a&gt; in the discussion of how a tango became approximately three minutes long, a prototypical tango has the structure ABA:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Most tangos, and most songs generally, are A-B-A in structure. It&#39;s a structure people seem to like, it works well musically and in a song. 16-bar blues follow much the same pattern. In practice, we get three segments of around 16 bars each. 16 bars to a minute, mas o menos, 48 bars start to finish. 48 bars of four beats each, that&#39;s 192 beats in three minutes, which is... 64 beats a minute. A familiar number. 192 heart beats to a tango.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best example to look for in my knowledge is the orchestra of Carlos Di Sarli, which adhered fairly strictly to a regular scheme for all his tangos.  A musician I met in Buenos Aires told me that Di Sarli was known as the master of something I think he called the quadratic form or something similar. The 16 bars (or measures as they are often called) can again be divided into four phrases of 4 bars of two strong and two weak beats each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what is more interesting than this little arithmetic is that these 4 sections of 4 bars form a structure of theme and variations inside the main structure of the tango. Gustavo Naveira called this &amp;lsquo;call&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;response&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;question&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;answer&amp;rsquo;, I don&amp;rsquo;t recall exactly. My musician friend objected to this and called them variations.  Whatever you want to call it, it is there, and you can hear it and use it in your dancing if you like. With the second being a response to the first and the fourth being a response to the third, there is also some sort of nested structure of dialogue between the first two phrases and the two last. Very neat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, creating a choreography is an art in itself, and sadly there are very few that master this art &amp;lsquo;a full&amp;rsquo;, as they would say in Buenos Aires. Taking this structural knowledge into the choreography would be a good framework to build a choreography around, one would imagine. In my own attempts to do semi choreography dances, matching the main turning points of the music was always a major concern, and that is why I find it so surprising (and disappointing) that so many performances seem to pay no attention at all to the general structure of the song they are performing to. Not even the main structure of main theme (A or AA), the contrasting theme (B) and the final variation (A again). I mean, not even reflecting the development from beginning to end. Just unmotivated throwing out of crowd pleasing steps in all directions from the start. I don&amp;rsquo;t get it. It is soooo boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this seems to be a disease which is prominent with the followers of the maestro that first taught me about this in a dance context. I find it somewhat ironic that the dancers most concerned with the &amp;lsquo;structure of tango&amp;rsquo; (the dance) seem to overlook completely the structure of tango (the music). Maybe it will come later in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2009/01/16/reinvention/&#34;&gt;reinvention&lt;/a&gt; project?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we are not doing choreography, you may protest. True, but still you have to listen to the music, and knowing just a little about what to listen for, might improve your listening (and thus dancing) experience. One gringo that was also taking the same seminar with Naveira found that part of the class utterly uninteresting  &amp;ndash; clearly you can already hear this, he said. Which is sort of true for many dancers, on the other hand, watching many people dance, one has to wonder&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I do not suggest that you start counting over and over again while you are out at the milongas dancing with your friends and strangers in the night, far from it. However, it can be useful to listen carefully for the specific developments of the music during one tango and try dancing to it. It should come as no surprise that a large number of step combinations taught are actually matching exactly one phrase in tango (8 strong beats or four measures/bars). Try it with the normal basic step if you still remember it&amp;hellip; Also it can be useful to try combining walking exercises (which you still do regularly, no?) with phrasing exercises. For example doing one kind of adornos for one full phrase. No less and no longer. Exactly one phrase. I suggest you try with Di Sarli, pick any song basically, as he conforms fairly closely to this scheme. We have good experience with walking our student through these exercises, even without much explanation, as moving with the phrases gives an intuitive understanding of the music, which you will eventually bring to the dance floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jorge Dispari talked about how people &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2009/05/10/on-circulation/&#34;&gt;used to interpret the music in a more similar fashion&lt;/a&gt; in the golden age of tango, I suspect this might be part of what he was talking about (the A(A)BA structure). I everyone is saving their giros and extra stuff for the final variation, then everybody stops progressing at the same time, and nobody gets hurt.. Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to take his music seminar, so this remains my theory or speculations if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, comments and corrections from more knowledgeable readers are most welcome&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Walking on high heels</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;599&amp;rdquo; caption=&amp;ldquo;Cinderella discovers the risk involved in dancing too wildly while wearing glass shoes&amp;rdquo;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wulffmorgenthaler.com/strip.aspx?id=d4269d90-fc41-4bfe-b444-9dcc17424911&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.wulffmorgenthaler.com/striphandler.ashx?stripid=d4269d90-fc41-4bfe-b444-9dcc17424911&#34; alt=&#34;Cinderella discovers the risk involved in dancing too wildly while wearing glass shoes&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sure he was great, but don&#39;t forget that Ginger Rogers did everything he did, backwards... and in high heels.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of dancing with a woman in Buenos Aires who really knew how to operate her feet. She worked in television in her country, and was known as  &amp;rsquo;the woman that knows how to walk on high heels&amp;rsquo;. That skill she had developed on the tango dance floor. Whenever they needed someone classy walking around with high heels, they called her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Buenos Aires I suspect it to be the other way around. Women bring their skill in high heels to their first tango lesson. And that must be a great start in learning how to dance. It often amazes me how well dancers in Buenos Aires dance after a couple of years, compared with the very best dancers back home. Even after dancing for ten years, practicing a lot and taking hundreds and hundreds of lessons. When porteños walk into their first lesson, they already know the music. And they already know how to walk like a porteño (Duh!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, sitting at a café, watching people walk by, or walking in the streets myself, I have noticed that women walking in the streets at home and in south of Europe and Buenos Aires walk very differently (The same goes for the men, but they are usually not in high heels). Shoes with high heels are much more common in the two latter places, and the women wearing them are much more likely to walk well, while the ones in Northern Europe and the US tend to stumble around. Like they are afraid the shoes are about to break into pieces. Well - maybe they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came in as la princesa was catching up on the tv series &amp;lsquo;Sex &amp;amp; the City&amp;rsquo; (If this were a wikipedia article, this would be the &amp;hellip;in popular culture-section). It is a series where expensive designer stilettos played a major part if I understand it correctly, and I watched the main character walking, or rather not-falling, down some stairs and out on the street. I asked myself why she even bothered with the fancy shoes, when she didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to wear them. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t really look good when you cannot walk. According to la princesa, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t even the worst example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cat-like, smooth steps, on the other hand, are practical as well as beautiful, as the time of impact is stretched, reducing the forces at work at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going directly from a life in flat shoes to long nights with Comme il faut in the milongas may indeed cause pain, both in feet/Achilles and back. This is true both for women and men (even without the Comme il fauts), but probably more for women. The shoes are called &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiletto&#34;&gt;stiletto&lt;/a&gt;s for a reason; they are dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have thought of four things that may help you from getting hurt from dancing with stiletto heels (which may be necessary, but not necessarily sufficient):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The right technique&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shoes that fit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good partner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could reveal the &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2008/11/11/the-secret-dont-tell-anyone/&#34;&gt;secret&lt;/a&gt; to the right technique walk in this post, but as you know, it&amp;rsquo;s not that simple. If you have been walking on them since you were&amp;hellip; &amp;ndash; well, younger, you know how to do it. If not, you have to catch up somehow. Just like with the music. You have put in the hours, and you have to walk the miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important things to work on are balance, placing the weight on the inside of the ball of the foot, actually walking on the heel when going forwards, pushing off with the grounded foot for each step and absorb the impact slowly when putting weight on the other foot. Using the muscles in the leg. And use the toes to spread out and support you. You have four joints to help you absorb the shock and push you into the next step. Toes/forefeet, ankles, knees and hips. Use all four in different amount, depending on how you like your tango. But then, rather than rely on a text on the internet, take some privates with someone really good. Then practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as I was writing this, there was a report on the news that many women get orthopedic problems because they wear too small shoes. Make sure your &lt;strong&gt;shoes fit&lt;/strong&gt; your foot, ladies! You need space for your toes to use them correctly, at the same time you need a shoe that sits firmly on. Quoting la princesa: It is like a good abrazo: Let the shoe give your foot an embrace that is firm and secure, yet allows your toes to move and your foot to &amp;lsquo;breathe&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good technique alone is not enough, you also need to develop foot &lt;strong&gt;strength&lt;/strong&gt; to enjoy long nights of tango in these exquisite stilettos. Unfortunately, that takes some time. I remember from my time as a rock climber that finger strength took a long time to develop, as there really aren&amp;rsquo;t much muscles in the fingers. They are in the underarm, and are rather small, hence it takes extra time to grow them stronger. The same is true for the foot, I believe, except the muscles are in the leg, of course&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In earlier times they didn&amp;rsquo;t use special &amp;lsquo;tango shoes&amp;rsquo;, they would walk right in from the street into the milonga and start dancing (without changing shoes), many still do. Being used to walking in high heels also outside the milonga must really help building foot strength over time. By the way, some Argentine tango teachers told us that women (in tango) used to wear steeper shoes before, but that these are hard to find these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are not dancing alone, and whether you are able to walk well ultimately depends on the man&amp;rsquo;s skills as well. The woman needs to be able to move confidently by herself, and a &lt;strong&gt;good partner&lt;/strong&gt; will give her that freedom. No guessing games. You might need to be more selective with dancing partners. If your partner is throwing you around, no amount of good technique or strength is going to help you in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So are the high heels any good?&lt;/strong&gt; Apart from that they look gorgeous, I have wondered if they offer any practical advantage. I am still not sure they do, but it definitely feels better dancing with a woman who knows how to walk in high heels when she&amp;rsquo;s wearing her Comme il fauts, compared with the same dancer in &amp;lsquo;tango sneakers&amp;rsquo; ala Fabio shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if using low heels or flat shoes tempt to put down the free leg, thus working against being ready for next step? Walking (as in actually walking) backwards, they can make life easier by letting you put down your heel, preparing for the next back step. This depends on absolutely crystal clear lead from your partner and under no circumstances any feints. As I wrote above: no guessing games. I can&amp;rsquo;t really see how the woman is supposed to get more rest in flat shoes; then she never gets to put her weight down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High heels seem to have a bad reputation in killing women&amp;rsquo;s  feet. I am not sure how much is because of the inherent danger of the shoe itself, and how much is because of &amp;lsquo;wrong use&amp;rsquo;. Finding out is made more difficult by the selection bias, both with respect to who gets in trouble and goes to the doctor with foot pain (missing technique/wrong size etc overrepresented?), and who stays with the tango over time/life (those who don&amp;rsquo;t get into serious foot trouble?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; you might still get in trouble with your feet, maybe due to some unknown weakness that gets exposed after taking up dancing, even if you have a brilliant partner, excellent technique and strong feet. (But I think it is far less likely).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a word from la princesa, who was kind to read over this before I  posted: walk &lt;strong&gt;with&lt;/strong&gt; your high heels, not **on **them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending a lot of time relearning how to walk, and teaching others to do the same, it is refreshing to watch a (very) young man learning to walk, in fact learning basically everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following him from being unable to hold his own head, through rolling around and sitting up, getting up by means of whatever furniture or grown up legs are in his proximity is fascinating. It is such a cliché, but watching my son learning all these things is watching a miracle unfold. Un milagro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the the time he will be the age most children learn to walk, we are planning to go to Buenos Aires, and we were kind of hoping he would take his first steps there. Which would be really poetic for a tango dancer, no? However, by his enthusiasm of practicing walking and standing up for short moments unsupported, he might just beat the scheme, like his mother did before him. Time will tell. And my back will hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officially, he will take his first steps there anyways, of course ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was so excited to see how it worked out with Stella and Javier on their tour this year. And this is just soooo beautiful! My piano teacher used to tell me when I practiced the hard parts: don&amp;rsquo;t forget breathing! This left me breathless, so dear reader, unless you can keep your breath for three minutes: don&amp;rsquo;t forget breathing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;s with this &lt;em&gt;marathon&lt;/em&gt; thing that seems to be spreading across Europe? I never found anything positive about marathons, running and sweating for hours on asphalt with no break and being totally destroyed afterwards?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, people may dance as they like. Myself, I prefer a nice milonga, champagne at the table, nice and clean clothes, nice and calm. Having a ball. Walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing tango with other dances, salsa for instance, some find the other dances so much fuller of life. Sparkling. Bubbling over of life and joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tango is rarely bubbling over. It is more self contained. Directing the energy inwards. More like boiling under pressure.  More intensity and energy, but perhaps less visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember so well one of my first times to a festival. As usual, people were going crazy on the dance floor, using brownian motion as the guiding principle. Except one couple.  Calm and strong,  they were wading through the chaos with confidence. Making space. Taking their time. It made a strong impression. Strong indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later the same night, they were giving a performance, of course. Ignorant me did not know about Roberto Herrera and Natacha Poberaj. A fabulous performance, sparkling and energetic, so good that few in the world would be able to match it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the dancing in the crowd left a much stronger impression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; -I see a lot of men are not dancing. They can&#39;t manage to dance when the floor is so full of people.
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; -It may not be because of lack of ability. It may be because they enjoy the dance more when the floor is not packed and they can more around the floor in their dance. Maybe they are waiting for their favorite music.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One friend commented on me and my wife sitting a lot more in the milongas than we used to after our longest stay in Buenos Aires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do remember the urge to dance every second of the milonga, afraid I might miss something. I do not miss those days. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.limericktango.com/blog/&#34;&gt;Limerick&lt;/a&gt; states this brilliantly in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.limericktango.com/2008/05/of-bulls-young-and-old/&#34;&gt;his post about the two bulls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Secret -- Don&#39;t tell anyone</title>

&lt;p&gt;The main character is asked to prepare an omelet in the morning for his master, a Parisian intellectual. Feeling his cooking is underappreciated, he contemplates the intellectuals&amp;rsquo; missing reflection on his artistry in the kitchen. This is clearly about tango: (From Monique Truong&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Book of Salt:)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like children, gullible and full of wonder, they always ask, &#34;What is your secret?&#34;

Do I look like a fool? I ask myself each time. Please, Madame, do not equate my lack of speech with a lack of thought. If there is a secret, Madame, I would take it with me to my unmarked grave, hide it in my bony jaw, the place my tongue would be if it had not rotted away. (...)

They all believe in a &#34;secret&#34; ingredient, a balm for their Gallic pride, a magic elixir that anyone can employ to duplicate my success. Its very existance threatens my own. (...) If there is a &#34;secret&#34;, Madame, it is this: Repetition and routine. Servitude and subservience. Beck and call.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should read the passage in context, it is too long to fit in a blog post, it is in the beginning of chapter 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: Many thanks to my lovely wife for serving me the delicious omelet and sharing the secret. (The recipy is in the same chapter :-) )&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Salón Canning</title>

&lt;p&gt;I realize that the guys at Movement invites movement are not afraid of provocation, but I think they suffer a tiny bit from a syndrome often associated with Gringos, shooting from the waist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their &lt;a href=&#34;http://movementinvitesmovement.wordpress.com/2008/10/28/gringo-milongas/&#34;&gt;rant abot Canning&lt;/a&gt;,  they fail to recognize a few important reasons Canning has such an important position. Aside from being one of the very best floors in the city (maybe &lt;em&gt;the very best&lt;/em&gt;), it attracts many excellent dancers. Both local and visitors. Both traditional and nuevo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also happens to be the one milonga that stayed open during the dirty war when tango dancing in effect was prohibited in Argentina. This is probably part of the reason why it is indeed the &lt;em&gt;famous&lt;/em&gt; Canning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I believe &lt;a href=&#34;http://parakultural.com.ar/&#34;&gt;Parakultural&lt;/a&gt;, the organizer on Mondays and Fridays was one of the first in the revival of tango 10-15 years ago, and this is why these days are among the most popular at Canning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, Parakultural may be a victim of its own success, and the most busy hours, it can be practically impossible to get around the dance floor. It only takes one couple to ruin the flow of an entire floor, and when the floor is packed, well, you get stuck. It usually gets better later in the night after most of the turistas go home ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, for us who enjoy walking and good rotation on the dance floor, the milongas out of the centre may be a better alternative. Sigh. If only I were there too&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t it funny how we see so different things, even when watching the exact same event?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://flickr.com/photos/rykerstribe/2589081910/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/eye-of-the-beholder.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;In the eye of the beholder&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember seeing containers all over the place while we were renovating our appartment, a friend who is an architect and carpenter seemed to literally see through the walls in the house before we bought it. A trained art expert will instantly recognize the work of an artist, an analyst will see through the endless rows of numbers in a spreadsheet&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we see people dancing, we notice different things. Where one sees excellent and clear lead, the other sees excessive adornos. Where one sees innovative moves, another sees boring repetition, where one sees old clichés, another sees elegance, musicality and smootheness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe we in many regards see what we are looking for, and what we find familiar. In other words, when we are working on some element in our own dance, we are more likely to see who masters this particular element in other dancers. And easily fail to see other qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, being able to notice excellence in others, requires a certain skill level. To be able to judge musicality, you need to know what is musical. To determine who has the better walk, you need to know how the walk &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be. And so on. It has taken years and months for me to be able to determine by sight whether someone is a good dancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, on occations I have been able to spot a good dancer before she even changed her shoes. I would not say I am able to say exactly what it is that gives a good dancer away, but the way they walk is something I always pay attention to. High heels can be faked. the way you walk in them can&amp;rsquo;t. Only the good dancers got it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, do we see the same walk?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Masquerade</title>
      <link>http://simbatango.com/2008/10/31/masquerade/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Who are you when you are dancing? Are you the leader? The follower? The man? The woman? I was once confronted with my using the terminology man/woman in class. The person complaining said that she was dancing a &lt;em&gt;role&lt;/em&gt; (she was dancing the man&amp;rsquo;s part) and that was the role of the leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this easily gets messy, but I never liked the euphemism leader/follower when what we are talking about is a man and a woman in most cases. Being a follower implies being passive, and sort of gives the leader higher value. When it can easily be argued that it is quite the oposite. The man dances _ for the woman_, remember? &lt;em&gt;She&lt;/em&gt; is the high value part of the relationship. To be cherished and taken good care of. Embraced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, with love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years back I took a class about communication and backleading. We were asked to try and verbalize what we were communicating in our dance. While I did not like the lesson much, something interesting came up. I tried finding the words, my mood maybe, happy or sad, if I had a good day at work and so on. The interesting part was the answer from another couple at the class. They dismissed the whole idea of the communication comprising more than &lt;em&gt;mere movements&lt;/em&gt;. While they were very good dancers, I think they miss out on something very important if they limit the dance to merely movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a related note, Javier in a class talked about daring to enjoy embracing and walking together, and how using too many steps like sacadas etc would create a distance between the two in the couple. And he was not talking about the physical distance between the dancers, but about not connecting with your partner on a deeper level than merely doing steps together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lower the mask and dare dance as yourself. Don&amp;rsquo;t play games. Dare showing your true self. You might be lucky and get the same in return.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Putting the baby to sleep</title>
      <link>http://simbatango.com/2008/10/14/putting-the-baby-to-sleep/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2008 20:49:32 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>http://simbatango.com/2008/10/14/putting-the-baby-to-sleep/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I quite recently became a father, and the poor child is exposed to a lot of tango music, naturally. (And I get out to dance less, hence the blog writing.) Before he was born, I used to talk about how we would practice walking together, he and I. Now this is how it turned out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene: Unpatiant 12 days old boy, waiting for his mother to get ready for breast-feeding. Father to find something to entertain the child, and preferably also himself in the meantime. Time for tango. Di Sarli&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Nido Gaucho&lt;/em&gt; on the stereo, practicing the tango walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boy seemed to enjoy the experience, I would say. Not as big eyes as with the milonga a few days earlyer (yes - really). After one tango and a half, he became more quiet. A few other songs from the same album, then the &lt;em&gt;Porteño y bailarín&lt;/em&gt; album from the start. The boy fell asleep in my arms. And I got to practice my walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funny thing about this, is that having a baby in your arms, getting it to sleep is a quite common metaphor for the way the woman should be held in the embrace. Soft, yet firm and secure.  I know at least El &amp;ldquo;Negro&amp;rdquo; Capello and Javier Rodríguez have used this metaphor. The thing is, I spent quite a lot of time practicing my tango embrace, but not making babies sleep. I got the idea, of course, but now I could apply the metaphor in the reverse direction, using my tango skills to get the boy to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I fell asleep quite happily that night myself.&lt;/p&gt;
