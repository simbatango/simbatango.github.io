&amp;ndash;You have to realize, Simba, that there are great non-Argentine teachers, too! This argument came up in a heated debate, and while I agree in principle, the teachers she had in mind were mediocre at best, so it didn&amp;rsquo;t really change my opinion much. In an online debate along similar lines, I once noticed an attempt to ridicule the ones pointing out the Argentines&amp;rsquo; comparative advantage in tango by comparing them to people holding the view that the &amp;lsquo;negroes had it in their blood&amp;rsquo; (when talking about rhythm, obviously).</description>

There was something she said that stayed with me. So well put. &amp;lsquo;When he leads a step, say backwards for the woman&amp;rsquo;, Graciela said, &amp;lsquo;then there is one possibility: going backwards. There are not three possible steps. Not three, not two. One.&amp;rsquo;
All the time I see so called &amp;lsquo;advanced&amp;rsquo; dancers, throwing their partners around, the women looking like nervous chicken trying to guess the right thing to do for each and every step.</description>

I had a laugh when I read this part by MovementInvitesMovement. In their wonderful, provocative style, they wrote an entire post about something that I hinted at in a comment in my post about clothes and tango.
Some hard core dancers would say that if it gets too warm with the jacket on, you are waisting energy ![;-)](http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif) When my beloved wife read that, her immediate reaction was: hard core dancers?</description>

      <description>I was considering using a grandiose title for this post. Something like Return of a King or The Comeback or something along those lines. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite feel that way. I feels more like finally getting a kick in the butt, and slowly getting out of the quagmire, one millimeter at the time.
Actually it was rather two kicks in the butt. The first was that a couple we know here that is in the same situation as us actually went to a tango dance before us.</description>

      <description>**Jim used to wonder** why he never enjoyed dancing---why he hesitated whenever he asked a friend to be his partner. One evening when he was trying to make up his mind to ask a very charming young lady to dance, he suddenly realized that if his dancing were more modern... he would get more enjoyment out of life. Jim took a few lessons at the Arthur Murray Studios. Today he is not only an excellent dancer, but he has also gained poise and confidence.</description>

Elegance. You know it when you see it, but it can be hard to point your finger at exactly what it is that makes a couple elegant.
Effortlessness. Natural movement. Simple, clean and concise. No wasted energy.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t come easy.</description>

-Have you been practicing tango nuevo? Guilty as charged.
He knew immediately. And it was not because I used an open embrace, we were practicing milonga, using a very confined embrace.
I often wonder why people get so hang up on the somewhat arbitrary distinction between open and close embrace (all teachers, both &amp;ldquo;nuevo&amp;rdquo; and others usually promote very close embrace at times, but for some figures it is not possible to maintain the closest embrace.</description>

Privates can be tough. Very useful, but tough.
On our first trip to Buenos Aires, my wife and I took privates with Julio &amp;amp; Corina, and we worked on the basics. Of course. We learnt a lot, but it was so much to think about. So much we did wrong. So much to fix.
For my own sake, it felt like they deconstructed my whole body, just to leave the parts on the floor.</description>

As you probably know, tango is not merely a dance. Among other things, the dance is also a language. It is not like a language, because the different movements have different meanings, which can be used for actual communication. It is not a metaphor. However, when people copy movements without realizing the underlying meaning, the result is movements with no meaning. Empty movement.
Or even worse, you may be saying something without knowing it.</description>

Buenos Aires is not like home. And when in Rome, drive like the Romans&amp;hellip;
And the Argentines kiss when they meet. Better get used to it.
(...) would lean over, ready to commit the act that, I thought, was reserved only for girlfriends and, on occasion, family. This guy used a few months it seems, but has written a really entertaining account of the argentinian kissing habits.</description>

Ah -- you dance **real** milonga (echte Milonga). After struggling with my milonga for years, this was the ultimate sign I was finally getting somewhere. And one of my favorite compliments ever. I got a tip from the Argentine host to ask this woman to dance, he thought I should dance with someone good. So I did. And was not disappointed. Starting almost right out with a milonga, which would have terrified me only a year earlier.</description>

Ready for a new year of tango? Remember that if you want to improve, there is no secret, all you have to do is to follow three simple steps:
 Learn from the best
 Practice (a lot)
 Listen to lots of music
  Nobody ever said it was gonna be easy ;-)</description>

      <description>Roy Lichtenstein: Girl with Ribbon (1965)
There is always a lot of fuzz in the tango communities of the world about what is the right tango. And rightly so. There is good and there is bad tango.
But in the middle of these heated arguments, we need to remind ourselves of one thing. Tango culture is rich. There is a lot of diversity in tango. Tango is not only dance. It is also music for listening.</description>

Tango music for the non-argentine 21st century tango lover is often something of an acquired taste. At least for tango dancers. The recordings are old, the music sounds strange, we don&amp;rsquo;t understand the lyrics &amp;ndash; but we love the dance&amp;hellip;
After some time, we get more into the music, it all changes, and we become total fanáticos de tango, we can never get enough of the classics of tango music.</description>

      <description>by my hovercraft is full of eels
Which one is most important? Technique or dancing with feeling? I sometimes get the impression that tango dancers are divided in two camps, the technique camp and the feelings camp. The first emphasizes the technical matters of the dance, the latter paying solely attention to the feeling. As long as we can hug each other, all is well ;-) Both seemingly ignoring the other point of view completely.</description>

      <description>Some of our students are going to Buenos Aires tomorrow. Oh the memories&amp;hellip;
I made sure they were equipped with the latest editions of El tangauta and B.A. Tango, giving a good overview over the happenings in November and December. They were always hard to get, even if they are given away for free, it could easily take a couple of weeks before we got hold of an issue. Now, they are available online, and one can prepare for the first week at home or on the plane down there.</description>

My previous post got me going on the habit that some dancers have of talking while dancing.
Just stop it, ok?
How can you possibly be listening to the music when you are talking at the same time? The conversation is going on in the dance, remember? And even if you somehow manage to do both at the same time, you are disturbing the others on the floor.</description>

      <description>The main character is asked to prepare an omelet in the morning for his master, a Parisian intellectual. Feeling his cooking is underappreciated, he contemplates the intellectuals&amp;rsquo; missing reflection on his artistry in the kitchen. This is clearly about tango: (From Monique Truong&amp;rsquo;s The Book of Salt:)
Like children, gullible and full of wonder, they always ask, &#34;What is your secret?&#34; Do I look like a fool? I ask myself each time.</description>

      <description>Models can be very useful. By making a simplified version of the world that we are able to grasp, we may learn something about the world outside the model as well. This approach has proven very successful in a lot of areas, and is also applied to tango.
There is a danger associated with model building, as everyone working with them should know, and that is to mistake the model for reality.</description>

I remember seeing containers all over the place while we were renovating our appartment, a friend who is an architect and carpenter seemed to literally see through the walls in the house before we bought it. A trained art expert will instantly recognize the work of an artist, an analyst will see through the endless rows of numbers in a spreadsheet&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Johanna&amp;rsquo;s comment and her subsequent post on leads and follows inspired me to write an entire post in addition to the comment in her blog. In her post (and follow-up) she argues why you would want to use the terms lead and follow for the two dancers in a tango embrace, and discuss howthey are surrounded with angst.
I find it to be the terms man and woman that are surrounded by angst, and that is probably the reason people use lead and follow as euphemisms for man and woman.</description>

      <description>When should you go to Buenos Aires?I would say: as soon as possible. Go before it&amp;rsquo;s too late! You will gain nothing by waiting. You will not be good enough, anyway ;-) But do by all means go!
If you wait until you are ready, you risk missing out on the entire thing. Going to milongas in your neighborhood, you will believe you improve to become a good dancer, and that you know what tango is about.</description>

      <description>Sometimes people are complaining that tango dancers are oh so serious. Never smiling or laughing. Relax, and have som fun, why so serious?
For me, I have always had a hard time agreeing on tango being fun. Of course it can be great fun, especially milonga, but not primarily fun. Fun actually has very little to do with it. That is not to say that I do not enjoy tango, on the contrary, I enjoy it very much.</description>

      <description>I quite recently became a father, and the poor child is exposed to a lot of tango music, naturally. (And I get out to dance less, hence the blog writing.) Before he was born, I used to talk about how we would practice walking together, he and I. Now this is how it turned out:

      <description>Why do people take classes? When I first started out in tango, I assumed people attended to classes to learn how to dance or to improve their dance, learning steps or improving technique or other skills. How naïve.
After several years more, I have discovered that people take classes for a variety of reasons, some of which I find perfectly reasonable, others I still cannot really understand. The good reasons are:</description>
