      <description>Make no mistake. This is ballet. Julio Bocca is a famous ballet dancer, and was praised by Juan Carlos Copes in Tango: Bayle Nuestro, so to watch his take on tango, Bocca Tango was intriguing. (You can get it @ ebay)
What I didn&amp;rsquo;t know before watching it was that this performance leads me back to the very beginnings of my own tango journey. It was performed at the Maipo theatre in 2001, and I think it was on at the time of my first visit to Buenos Aires.</description>

      <description>&amp;ndash;So when are you guys going on tour? &amp;ndash;Well. I don&amp;rsquo;t know. It&amp;rsquo;s no hurry&amp;hellip;
A few months later, they are teaching and performing in Hong Kong. Never in a hurry, but moving along nicely. Just as it is supposed to be.</description>

      <description>As I was uploading a couple of new videos at youtube, I noticed the &amp;lsquo;Attention&amp;rsquo; ranking of my videos in the &amp;lsquo;Insights&amp;rsquo; section. The video with most attention (showed by a red bar like in the illustration top centre) is a video showing Jorge Dispari and María &amp;lsquo;La Turca&amp;rsquo; del Carmen at Confitería Ideal. At the time of writing, this video has been viewed 11 852 times.
Youtube describes the calculation of the video &amp;lsquo;hot spots&amp;rsquo; like this: &amp;rdquo;The ups-and-downs of viewership at each moment in your video, compared to videos of similar length.</description>

      <description>Marisa Galindo was directing a show in honor of the milongueros, and she is now posting footage from this show on youtube for all of us to see! The show was filmed on the 16th of October 1991, Homenaje a los Milongueros de Buenos Aires.
I have seen fragments of this show before, but didn&amp;rsquo;t know the source, and this seems to be much better quality and I think complete. Truth to be told, I haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to watch it all yet, but I will, and I will watch it again.</description>

Staying in Buenos Aires for a few months provided several eye-openers. One of the great revelations was concerning the logic of the dance, or rather the lack of it, and how this adds spice to the dance:
We were taking lessons with various teachers, with very different philosophies with respect to tango, how to dance it and how to learn it. Gustavo Naveira, the great master, dissected each step carefully, explaining exactly how and why and which steps were crossed and which were open etc.</description>

      <description>Just because tango can be deep and serious, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it can&amp;rsquo;t be a lot of fun, too.
I remember learning very early about the three musical genres: milonga was fun, tango serious and vals about love&amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip;so no coincidence that two out of three are milongas:

      <title>Technique vs. Feeling</title>

      <description>by my hovercraft is full of eels
Which one is most important? Technique or dancing with feeling? I sometimes get the impression that tango dancers are divided in two camps, the technique camp and the feelings camp. The first emphasizes the technical matters of the dance, the latter paying solely attention to the feeling. As long as we can hug each other, all is well ;-) Both seemingly ignoring the other point of view completely.</description>
