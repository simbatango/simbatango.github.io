      <title>Bocca Tango</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/julio-bocca-tango.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/julio-bocca-tango.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake. This is ballet. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_Bocca&#34;&gt;Julio Bocca&lt;/a&gt; is a famous ballet dancer, and was praised by Juan Carlos Copes in Tango: Bayle Nuestro, so to watch his take on tango, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.grupomaipo.com.ar/bocca_tango/&#34;&gt;Bocca Tango&lt;/a&gt; was intriguing. (You can &lt;a href=&#34;http://global.ebay.com/DVD_BOCCA_TANGO_-_JULIO_BOCCA_-_TEATRO_MAIPO_-_2004_NEW/180488335652/item&#34;&gt;get it @ ebay&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I didn&amp;rsquo;t know before watching it was that this performance leads me back to the very beginnings of my own tango journey. It was performed at the Maipo theatre in 2001, and I think it was on at the time of my first visit to Buenos Aires.  The choreography is  by &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana_Mar%C3%ADa_Stekelman&#34;&gt;Ana María Stekelman&lt;/a&gt; that also choreographed some of the numbers in &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Saura&#34;&gt;Carlos Saura&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120274/&#34;&gt;Tango&lt;/a&gt;. A movie that had such a great impact on me and my wife that we consider it partly responsible for us taking up tango for real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The music selection in Bocca Tango covers a lot of tango classics and some Piazzolla, and overall I liked it very much. The show was well put together, showing a variety of music and dance. In particular I liked the interpretation of Balada para un loco (!), which was fairly simple, but touching. Some of the most tango like dancing is a little strange when you are used to regular, improvised tango, because it is danced with ballet technique. Mostly it worked out fine, interesting and at its best moving.  Not everything, of course, but some parts were striking, some funny (for example Bocca doing a gancho on a table :-). Some parts similar to the choreography in the Saura movie. And the last black dress was stunning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical quality of the dvd was a bit disappointing, the colors were rather bleak and the hand held camera was a bit annoying at times. The cover contained very little information, so you basically have to go to the web to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an open mind and think you could appreciate ballet tango (literally), this is what you should get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;So when are you guys going on tour? &amp;ndash;Well. I don&amp;rsquo;t know. It&amp;rsquo;s no hurry&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months later, they are teaching and performing in Hong Kong. Never in a hurry, but moving along nicely. Just as it is supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/dispari-hot-spots.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/dispari-hot-spots.png&#34; alt=&#34;dispari-hot-spots&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As I was uploading a couple of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VT5x1Ncaf8&#34;&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1VsJhCfKS8&#34;&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; at youtube, I noticed the &amp;lsquo;Attention&amp;rsquo; ranking of my videos in the &amp;lsquo;Insights&amp;rsquo; section. The video with most attention (showed by a red bar like in the illustration top centre) is a video showing Jorge Dispari and María &amp;lsquo;La Turca&amp;rsquo; del Carmen at Confitería Ideal. At the time of writing, this video has been viewed 11 852 times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Youtube describes the calculation of the video &amp;lsquo;hot spots&amp;rsquo; like this:  &amp;rdquo;The ups-and-downs of viewership at each moment in your video, compared to videos of similar length. The higher the graph, the hotter your video: fewer viewers are leaving your video and they may also be rewinding to watch that point in the video again. Audience attention is an overall measure of your video&amp;rsquo;s ability to retain its audience.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this very interesting, as this graph shows a very nice development through the piece, like you would tell a good story. An interesting opening to catch your listener&amp;rsquo;s attention, then taking a long breath before you add details to build up towards the climax. Rounding off while it is still interesting. It correponds well with the structure of the music, Dispari saves his most elaborate tricks for the final variation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a way to share the nice setup pictured above where you can move the red line to change the part of the video to see what is happening at that moment in time, but you can watch the video here:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Marisa Galindo was directing a show in honor of the milongueros, and she is now &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/user/galindomarisa3971&#34;&gt;posting footage from this show on youtube&lt;/a&gt; for all of us to see! The show was filmed on the 16th of October 1991, Homenaje a los Milongueros de Buenos Aires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen fragments of this show before, but didn&amp;rsquo;t know the source, and this seems to be much better quality and I think complete. Truth to be told, I haven&amp;rsquo;t had  time to watch it all yet, but I will, and I will watch it again. And again. And so should you, haha!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staying in Buenos Aires for a few months provided several eye-openers. One of the great revelations was concerning the logic of the dance, or rather the lack of it, and how this adds spice to the dance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were taking lessons with various teachers, with very different philosophies with respect to tango, how to dance it and how to learn it. Gustavo Naveira, the great master, dissected each step carefully, explaining exactly how and why and which steps were crossed and which were open etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming then to another lesson with the quite different teachers, I asked once why I was to go with this foot, and not with the other, as I could not make any sense of this particular combination. Jorge looked at me, as if he did not understand the question. Why? Because the step is like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only later did it make any sense to me. It was actually when los Disparis showed another step. A step where the man deliberately hides which foot he has weight on. To make it less obvious which direction the turn will be.  Going in the not so logical direction. Or perhaps not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding a touch of finesse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember several years earlier, another tango teacher told us that the man should always have a little surprise for the woman, a sorpresita, to make her feel she was something special. And in the same way, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt having a sorpresita for the spectators as well. At least if you are giving a show, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this leads to one reason I find a lot of performances unbearably boring. The dancers do a lot of things, trying to be innovative. But it shows a mile a head where they are going. No sorpresita. Lacking even the slightest hint of finesse.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It can be fun, too!</title>
      <link>http://simbatango.com/2008/11/28/it-can-be-fun-too/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just because tango can be deep and &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2008/10/17/why-so-serious/&#34;&gt;serious&lt;/a&gt;, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it can&amp;rsquo;t be a lot of fun, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember learning very early about the three musical genres: milonga was fun, tango serious and vals about love&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;so no coincidence that two out of three are milongas:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Technique vs. Feeling</title>

&lt;p&gt;Which one is most important? Technique or dancing with feeling? I sometimes get the impression that tango dancers are divided in two camps, the technique camp and the feelings camp. The first emphasizes the technical matters of the dance, the latter paying solely attention to the feeling. As long as we can hug each other, all is well ;-) Both seemingly ignoring the other point of view completely. As a matter of fact, I used to get a little annoyed by people who dismissed technique and just wanted to be in the embrace, feeeeeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By what interests me nowadays, I can easily be mistaken for belonging in the feelings camp. I find the technical extravaganzas of many performances quite boring at times, as they convey no emotional content whatsoever (to me, that is). So have I moved to the other camp?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not really, I would rather say I belong in the both are necessary camp. I just  heard an interview on the radio with a conductor visiting one of the major symphony orchestras here, and he made the following statement about the two leading violinists in the orchestra (quoted as I remember it):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;They have very good technique, which allows them to express their musicality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is at the heart of the matter. You need good technique. You need it to express your musicality through your dance. You should work hard to improve it, but technique alone will not do. It is a necessary condition, but hardly sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just as the music critics rather discuss the interpretation of an orchestra or musician, I think the artistic interpretation is more interesting to discuss than the technical points. Technique is simple, really: all you need is good teachers and a lot of practice&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
