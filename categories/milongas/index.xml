&lt;p&gt;There is this new milonga in the the town I grew up, and of all things they have called it &lt;em&gt;La colgada&lt;/em&gt;. Now, that gives me all the wrong associations when it comes to a milonga, but from how I know the tango scene there, I guess it is merely truth in advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But come on, naming a milonga after a step/figure? Why on earth would you do that? I guess they think it sounds cool, but it sends out a signal that it is all about the step. And if you read anything I wrote before, you know I don&amp;rsquo;t subscribe to that view at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More reasonable things to use for names of a milonga would be music, selecting a song title or part of a phrase, something based on the location, or maybe the organizer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you want to signal an ambiance of warmth and inclusion, call it &lt;em&gt;El abrazo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Niño Bien has always been one of my favorite milongas, and when I found the picture I used for illustration of my post on organizing a milonga, I was reminded that, unlike the photographer, I have never been there early, before the milonga really starts. For some reason, we always arrive late..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and possibly stay late. Although not often so late as to hear the dj put on La Cumparsita, the tango often used to round off the night at Buenos Aires milongas. At Niño Bien, Mario Orlando was playing and like he usually does, played energetic tangos towards the end of the night, to squeeze out the last drop of the guests before they head home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On came a cumparsita so powerful and energetic I had never heard before. While the waiters were cleaning the tables, new waves of energy were bursting over the dance floor, the different instruments taking turns in leading on the next heave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a night!
What an ending!
What a cumparsita!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way out, we stopped by to ask Mario which orchestra he played last. It was Donato Racciatti. Guess who went right to Zival&amp;rsquo;s the next day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will never be the same as this first time though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-nd/2.0/80x15.png&#34; alt=&#34;Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 2.0 Generic License&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/people/chrisandsue/&#34;&gt; Chris and Sue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imagecodr.org/&#34;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting a milonga is easy, right? You just need a place to dance, put some music on, and there you go&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;well not exactly. There are lots of small and not so small details that work together to create a good environment for social dancing. Based on my experience as organizer of both unsuccessful events and much more successful events and experience from various milongas and practicas over the world, I attempt to gather some advice on how to approximate the authentic milonga in your own community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;location-location-location&#34;&gt;Location, location, location&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First you need a place &amp;ndash; large enough, but not too large. It really depends on how many attendants you can be expected to draw. To create the right social dynamics, it is necessary to feel that people fill the space without making it so crowded it is impossible to move or get a seat. Outside Buenos Aires, problems with the ronda are rarely caused by too little space available, as I discussed in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2009/05/10/on-circulation/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If possible, choose a not too remote location. It should be easy to get there by public transportation and there should be parking available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not start your milonga in an obscure cafe with a slow night on Mondays because you can stay there for free. There is a reason why that day is a slow night. And tango dancers generally spend little on drinks for some reason, so it won&amp;rsquo;t be a good deal for the owner and you may get thrown out again. And one thing you do want is stability, knowing you won&amp;rsquo;t have to cancel due to some random football match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, beginners are often intimidated by people watching, which also makes it a good idea to stay off public areas such as cafes or bars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many things may be said about sound system, floor etc, I will concentrate on factors that can be more easily changed in this overview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;time&#34;&gt;Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going to the milonga means going out. It is not a workout. Hence, it should be placed accordingly. If there is no regular milonga in your city, I suggest Friday night. Then you avoid most people having to leave early to go to work in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t start too early, let people have time to get home and get ready for their night out. So the exact timing depends on local customs, but 8 PM or 9 PM should work well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use a dj that knows what he&amp;rsquo;s doing. Or is willing to learn. Selecting music for a milonga is like cooking, the most important is that it is done &amp;lsquo;con mucho amor&amp;rsquo;. Just putting on a random cd will not cut it. Ideally the dj is not noticed, but facilitates dancing, creating a good mood&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use tandas and cortinas. This is much debated outside Bs As, but I prefer it mainly because it facilitates good dancing and circulation between partners. Remove as many barriers as possible for the activites you promote. Tandas and cortinas also socializes beginners into the general structure of a milonga and makes it easier for them to appreciate changes in the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only play &lt;a href=&#34;http://tejastango.com/tango_music.html&#34;&gt;the good stuff&lt;/a&gt;. This includes playing tango, milonga and vals. Different schemes are possible, 4T-4T-3M-4T-4T-3V usually works well. To get the party going you might consider using 4T-3M-4T-3V the first hour(s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless it is a niche you feel needs to be filled, avoid playing too much untraditional music. Stay with the true and proven tango music, predominantly golden age music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play loud enough that the music dominates the venue, but not so lound that it is impossible to talk at the tables. Ideally, talk from the tables should not be disturbing people at the dance floor, but this depends a lot on the sound system installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;layout&#34;&gt;Layout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need seating, and preferably also tables. Having chairs along the walls does not create a nice atmosphere, rather it mimics the dreaded image of an old fashioned dancing school, where people sit (un)patiently waiting to be asked to dance/nervously trying to gather the courage to move across the floor and ask someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Place tables surrounding the dance floor. Make space in the corners for easy access to the dance floor. Make it possible to walk around &lt;strong&gt;behind the tables&lt;/strong&gt;. Then people won&amp;rsquo;t have to cross the floor to walk over to their friends, asking someone to dance, going to the bar etc. In fact, make it possible to move around the entire dance floor without ever entering the dance floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Place the tables perpedicular to the edges of the floor with no chair on the end facing the floor nor the oposite end. Keeping chairs with people away from where people move facilitates movement on and off dance floor and avoids intimidating dancers unnecessarily by having people facing the dance floor &amp;lsquo;staring&amp;rsquo; at the dancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a rectangular dance floor, but not too stretched out. Use tables to shape the size of the floor on all four sides. However, if your attendance is too small to fill up the tables all around the floor, it is probably better to concentrate people on some sides, and use the walls on the others to avoid rows of empty tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may seem overly detailed, but these small details actually matter and they require little work to adjust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to make the dance floor smaller, it often improves flow and behaviour on the dance floor, as people actually need to pay attention to the others on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the entrance, it is useful to have someone to take cover charge and greet the guests. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough people to have one sitting at the door, you may use the &amp;lsquo;honor system&amp;rsquo;, but be prepared that quite a few of your guests will &amp;lsquo;forget&amp;rsquo; to pay the entrance. Using a list or some other visual reminder by the entrance that payment is expected might improve the honesty rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dj needs to sit so that he can watch the dance floor, changing the music depending on the crowd&amp;rsquo;s reactions and desires. The dj should not have other responsibilites while playing, as that is enough work for one person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lighting&#34;&gt;Lighting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is tempting to lower the lights to create a cozy atmosphere. Resist the temptation and keep it light enough to use the cabeceo and for watching the dance floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bar&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If possible, it should be a bar where you can buy something to drink (and eat). That includes wine, beer and champagne. Not that drinking much is important, but it reinforces the concept of going out, creating a relaxed social atmosphere. Most tango dancers don&amp;rsquo;t drink much as far as I have experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serving at the table is nice, but usually economically unviable in most smaller communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dresscode&#34;&gt;Dresscode&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dresscode is rarely strictly enforced, but dressing up is part of going to a milonga. It can be encouraged in several ways, by a mild formulation in the listings and by dressing up yourself. Many tango people like to dress up a little, and dressing up implies taking care of personal hygiene, which I have often seen mentioned as tips before &lt;em&gt;going&lt;/em&gt; to the milonga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the key words are &lt;strong&gt;going out&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;not workout&lt;/strong&gt;. Leave practice for the practica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;host&#34;&gt;Host&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If possible, get some help and be available as a host. Greeting people as they come, make them know you appreciate their attendence. Pay extra care to newcomers, possibly introduce them to some dancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Buenos Aires, you will routinely be escorted to your table, which is a nice gesture. I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it outside of Buenos Aires, though. Competition for the nice tables would require a really large community, I presume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t engage in heated debates with people who are only up to trouble. Smile and suggest you discuss it some other time, as the milonga is a place to enjoy yourself. Show them the way out if they refuse to stop. People who ruin the night for everybody else are not welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be a good role model, be nice with everybody and play by the rules yourself. This means dressing up appropriately, greeting people with a smile, dance a little, relax and have a drink :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-crowd&#34;&gt;The crowd&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important success factors of a milonga is the crowd that frequents the place. This is not something you can control directly, of course, but providing good facilities and above all good music gives you a fair chance to attract the crowd you would like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that experienced dancers often prefer the real stuff (dancing tango to.. tango music) and tend to arrive late, and stay late. A common arrangement is to cater for beginners early (classses and &amp;lsquo;easy music&amp;rsquo; and for the more experienced (more complex music) later in the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;formal-informal&#34;&gt;Formal/informal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A traditional milonga in Buenos Aires is actually a rather formal event. For some reason people in other parts of the world seem to have a problem with this, and many have as an explicit goal to make an &amp;lsquo;informal&amp;rsquo; atmosphere. In small communities, you will have to strike a balance there, but the more formal atmosphere of the Buenos Aires milongas makes a lot of things easier for dancers once you know the codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think what they should rather be going for is friendly and positive, rather than informal, some structure makes the night easier to work out for the dancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the implicit means listed above to facilitate the behaviour without enforcing strictly any rules works well in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pr&#34;&gt;PR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider giving a class before the milonga starts with entrance to the milonga included, as classes often draw more people. This is a commonly used trick to promote milongas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a clean website with updated information on hours, prices and how to get there. Keep it up to date rather than fancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make flyers to distribute at other milongas if they exist in your city&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add your milonga to online listings and consider creating an online calendar ala google calendar that people can subscribe to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start a mailing list with information about special events etc.Let people opt in and keep the number of postings low with relevant content. Ask organizers from other places, festivals etc to send you flyers to distribute at your milonga rather than spam your subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Place a table by the entrance with flyers, or place them directly on the tables. Having them in one spot makes it easier to administrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advertise truthfully what kind of music people can expect. If you play more than an occational set of alternatives before closing time, make it explicit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simba found a new cage. It has the most lovely hardwood floor. Parquet. Yum-ba! We&amp;rsquo;ll see how much milongas there will be in the new town, but Simba already started patrolling the new territory with enrosques and paradas thrown in here and there. And it is smooooth! So at least some private dancing inside the cave, while guarding the offspring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must admit floors mean a lot more to me after dancing tango for a while than they did before. I remember going to my first tango festival, and the more experienced dancers were discussing the quality of the floors in the different venues. ¿Que? A floor is a floor is a floor, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not so, some are soft, some are hard, smooth, slippy. Some are actually adding significantly to the dancing experience. Like the floor at Canning. Wow! A lot of nice places have terrible floors, though, so it&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; important, but I get all giggly inside whenever I step onto the floor at Canning. Sigh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;s with this &lt;em&gt;marathon&lt;/em&gt; thing that seems to be spreading across Europe? I never found anything positive about marathons, running and sweating for hours on asphalt with no break and being totally destroyed afterwards?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, people may dance as they like. Myself, I prefer a nice milonga, champagne at the table, nice and clean clothes, nice and calm. Having a ball. Walking.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Entering the milonga</title>

&lt;p&gt;The moment or should I say process of entering a milonga is very special for me. I think savoring the moment is something very important in tango, and for me it starts at the moment I am standing outside the milonga entrance. There is a certain amount of expectation for the night even before, of course, but this is when I really start enjoying the sensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I move into the building, the sound of music becomes more clear, maybe the dj plays a nice song, and I get this uplifted feeling, raising the expectations for the night. This is even more exciting for unknown milongas, but it goes for my regular milongas as well. I just love when I have to climb some stairs to get to the milonga (think Niño Bien), feeling the music getting stronger with each step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After entering the venue, I prefer taking a moment in the back, watching the floor. How is the mood today, who&amp;rsquo;s dancing, is it crowded, or will I there be space for the occacional caminata? Are any of my favorite dancers present, and if so, am I able to locate where they sit? I am now taking the first small steps towards taking action: finding a table, determining whom to ask (with the cabeceo, of course) to dance. If my friends are not dancing, I greet them and might sit at their table. If possible I change my shoes before entering, else I do it as discreetly as possible while taking in the mood of the night. Getting ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all milongas where they serve drinks, I get something to drink, a beer, maybe some champagne, and have a taste while I watch the floor and listen to the music. &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2008/11/18/waiting-for-the-right-moment/&#34;&gt;Waiting for the right moment&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write about this special moment for some time, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://enlamilonga.blogspot.com/2008/12/los-rituales-de-la-llegada.html&#34;&gt;challenge of una tanguera&lt;/a&gt; made it irresistable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of our students are going to Buenos Aires &lt;em&gt;tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;. Oh the memories&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made sure they were equipped with the latest editions of &lt;a href=&#34;http://eltangauta.com/&#34;&gt;El tangauta&lt;/a&gt; and B.A. Tango, giving a good overview over the happenings in November and December. They were always hard to get, even if they are given away for free, it could easily take a couple of weeks before we got hold of an issue. Now, they are available online, and one can prepare for the first week at home or on the plane down there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really wish I could be at Canning and see Cristhian and Samantha&amp;rsquo;s performance on Friday Thursday&amp;hellip; And Thursday the 27th is a tough one: &lt;a href=&#34;http://2xtango.com/es/2008/10/16/jueves-27-de-noviembre-bailan-javier-rodriguez-andrea-misse/&#34;&gt;Andrea y Javier in one milonga&lt;/a&gt;, Orquesta Típica Sans Souci and performance by Fabian Peralta y Virginia Pandolfi in another. And Niño Bien, of course. Well, ain&amp;rsquo;t I lucky that will not have to choose&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prepare for Buenos Aires or just to keep en eye on what&amp;rsquo;s going on down there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; -I see a lot of men are not dancing. They can&#39;t manage to dance when the floor is so full of people.
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; -It may not be because of lack of ability. It may be because they enjoy the dance more when the floor is not packed and they can more around the floor in their dance. Maybe they are waiting for their favorite music.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One friend commented on me and my wife sitting a lot more in the milongas than we used to after our longest stay in Buenos Aires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do remember the urge to dance every second of the milonga, afraid I might miss something. I do not miss those days. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.limericktango.com/blog/&#34;&gt;Limerick&lt;/a&gt; states this brilliantly in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.limericktango.com/2008/05/of-bulls-young-and-old/&#34;&gt;his post about the two bulls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Salón Canning</title>

&lt;p&gt;I realize that the guys at Movement invites movement are not afraid of provocation, but I think they suffer a tiny bit from a syndrome often associated with Gringos, shooting from the waist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their &lt;a href=&#34;http://movementinvitesmovement.wordpress.com/2008/10/28/gringo-milongas/&#34;&gt;rant abot Canning&lt;/a&gt;,  they fail to recognize a few important reasons Canning has such an important position. Aside from being one of the very best floors in the city (maybe &lt;em&gt;the very best&lt;/em&gt;), it attracts many excellent dancers. Both local and visitors. Both traditional and nuevo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also happens to be the one milonga that stayed open during the dirty war when tango dancing in effect was prohibited in Argentina. This is probably part of the reason why it is indeed the &lt;em&gt;famous&lt;/em&gt; Canning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I believe &lt;a href=&#34;http://parakultural.com.ar/&#34;&gt;Parakultural&lt;/a&gt;, the organizer on Mondays and Fridays was one of the first in the revival of tango 10-15 years ago, and this is why these days are among the most popular at Canning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, Parakultural may be a victim of its own success, and the most busy hours, it can be practically impossible to get around the dance floor. It only takes one couple to ruin the flow of an entire floor, and when the floor is packed, well, you get stuck. It usually gets better later in the night after most of the turistas go home ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, for us who enjoy walking and good rotation on the dance floor, the milongas out of the centre may be a better alternative. Sigh. If only I were there too&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Old tango hero</title>
      <link>http://simbatango.com/2008/10/09/old-tango-hero/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2008 20:53:53 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>http://simbatango.com/2008/10/09/old-tango-hero/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On our first visit to Buenos Aires, we rented a room in San Telmo. Right in the neighborhood is the Centro Cultural Torquato Tasso. For some reason we never came around to go there, even if it was by far the closest milonga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until one evening, we finally found space in our schedule to visit El Tasso. There was to be live music, and we were quite excited. The place was packed with people, and all of a sudden an old man was announced, and with support from a couple of guys he entered the stage. He was obviously going to sing with the orchestra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he started to sing, it was clear to us that he had once had a great voice, but we thought that was long ago. After the first song, however, his voice seemed to be warmed up, and we could hear with our own ears that this had been one of the great heros of tango music. And if we could not hear it, we could see it from the people in the room, cheering him from the back of the venue, singing along with all his famous tunes. (Of which we were shamefully ignorant). On the dance floor, I could hardly move at all. The pista felt so packed that if I would lift my feet, I would be carried with the flow. Quite frustrated, I could see that the more experienced dancers were doing all kind of stuff, giros and everything, all without taking any space. Amazing and very frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody was there, including some very famous dancers, and all the people we saw regularly in the milongas.  So one great experience richer, we wrote about the evening in our travel diary and went on with our schedule. Before returning home, we got some tips from our tango teachers for music to buy at Zival&amp;rsquo;s. The names Di Sarli, Troilo and D&amp;rsquo;Arienzo did not mean much at the time, and I remember being amazed by my teachers&amp;rsquo; spotting of Puglieses &lt;em&gt;Gallo ciego&lt;/em&gt; one evening at the &lt;em&gt;Niño Bien&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some years later, I was listening to a tango cd. And it struck me how similar this was to the old man in El Tasso. Could it be&amp;hellip;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the old travel diary, to check the details. I wondered if it could be &lt;em&gt;Alberto Castillo&lt;/em&gt;, a name I had grown to appreciate over the years. And in the diary it said black on white, that indeed, Alberto Castillo it was. One of the very great, and appreciated enthusiastically, however ignorantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;httpvh://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=sxELJ3Lccx8&amp;amp;NR=1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alberto Castillo died not much after, and I believe this was one of his last performances. which I am greatful to have experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The ideal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The previous &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/index.php/2008/09/23/confiteria-la-ideal-en-bbc/&#34;&gt;post about Confiteria Ideal&lt;/a&gt; reminded me of the first visit to Buenos Aires back in 2001. This was before YouTube, remember, and there was lots of rumors about everything, and not so much tango information available on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being interested in architecture as well as in tango, trying to find the location for a scene in the film Tango by Carlos Saura, we were told by someone that we should go to one of the oldest milongas in Buenos Aires, yes our source believed it would be the same milonga that was pictured in the movie.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/oCJq7SJqtAc&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We stayed in San Telmo, and this was before the crisis in &lt;sup&gt;2001&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2002&lt;/sub&gt;, so being students we really went on a shoestring budget. So we decided to take the bus. And asked the bus driver with our non-existing spanish to tell us where to go off the bus.  The bus drive took something like an hour, and we were dropped out in the middle of the street. Trying to find this milonga in the neighborhood of Villa Urquiza we found a nice baldaquin, leading into&amp;hellip; - a baseball court. With no people, only the waiters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming into the infamous Sunderland milonga, a few ours early, this was far from what we expected. Since then, we have learnt, of course, but expectations and reality can make some impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be the milonga at Sunderland (with excellent dancers Roxana &amp;amp; Sebastián:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;
