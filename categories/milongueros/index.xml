      <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazing how these old clips slowly surface on youtube and facebook. Here are some clips that seem to be from an old documentary, posted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.victorycristina.blogspot.com&#34;&gt;Victor Barrios and Cristina Benavidez&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standing in front of the window, glancing out. The day had long since started, yet it was dark outside. It was pouring down, despite being mid-winter. He saw through the rain. He saw through the house across the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What he saw was her smile.  Her dancing cumbia in the kitchen. Her explaining the concepts of &amp;ldquo;cheta&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;negro&amp;rdquo;. Her expertly preparing a mate. &amp;ldquo;Her standing on one leg in the Comme il Faut showroom, trying one shoe while putting on a second while asking for third pair. Effortlessly. Her standing in front of a man like a woman standing in front of a man. Her radiating as only a bride on her wedding day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These memories of happy moments were all so vivid, yet he did not smile. Instead tears found their way across his chin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind his back he heard laughter from his little boy, but he was thinking of a little girl that had lost her mother. Still so young she may not remember her mother when she grows up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He remembered the message to let him and his wife know that she too, was _embarazada,_ just a few months after she with a teasing smile left the gentlemen alone and went for a girl talk to check out the tummy of his wife where the little unborn boy was growing, still almost invisible. They would become &lt;em&gt;compañero y compañera&lt;/em&gt;, that&amp;rsquo;s only natural, she joked when the babies first met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He closed his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not the sorrow of a daughter losing her mother. It was not the sorrow of a husband losing his wife. It was not the sorrow of a sibling losing their sister. It was not the sorrow of a parent losing their child. It was not the sorrow of a tango dancer losing his partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not the sorrow of a student losing his teacher. It was my sorrow. The sorrow of losing a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course she changed my tango. I never knew what profound experience walking in an embrace could constitute until I learnt if from her. For these lessons I am grateful. Sometimes people say that young people cannot feel the true tango because they have not experienced the pains that accumulate over a lifetime. They say it like it is something to strive for, something admirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With her passing she will again change my tango. I will always bear the sorrow in my heart, and it will come through in my tango. It is a change I cannot withstand.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning From Early Music</title>

&lt;p&gt;In a sense, dancing Argentine Tango in 2011 in a country far away from Argentina is an inescapable anachronism. How could it ever be authentic? Should it be? Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t any art form evolve and develop in a quest for ever improvement? In the (un)concious choice between opposing traditions, which would be the right to follow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, these questions are not unique for tango of course:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The idea of revival has become a touchstone for the Early Music Movement, and consequently the fact that some styles of performance have been going on long enough to develop and build their own continuity presents some philosophical complications.

(...)

Labels such as &#34;authentic performance&#34; and &#34;composer&#39;s intentions&#34; have likewise been mostly abandoned, but this time primarily for philosophical rather than practical reasons. There are two basic facts underlining this decision. The first is that knowing precisely how a work was originally performed, especially one rather distant in time, is not really possible. The second is that, perhaps with a few exceptions, composers do not state their intentions with regard to hypothetical performances hundreds of years in the future. The idea that the composer &#34;wants&#34; the music to sound today exactly as it did for the first performance is simply a philosophical one.

(...)

[The] composition of a piece, especially one which we would want to hear centuries later, was a creative act made in the context of creative musicians. In this sense, if musicians today are to abandon any creativity when rendering old music, then they are _not_ authentic, because that is not the frame of mind under which the original was made. The same frame of mind is indeed impossible today, because the piece will never be new again. Of course, for many individuals, it will seem new, and that is part of what has made the revival aspect of early music so successful and exciting.

&gt; 
&gt; [http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/misc/whatis.htm](http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/misc/whatis.htm)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we have something to learn from the Early Music Movement. Tango dancing is from a not so distant past, but it has not been very well documented, and that leaves us with many of the same problems as interpreters of Early Music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I understand it, one important conductor of early music is &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Norrington&#34;&gt;Roger Norrington&lt;/a&gt;, and one of his pet peeves is the contemporary (over) use of the vibrato. (According to Mark Katz, due to the different needs of recorded music, a &amp;lsquo;phonographic effect&amp;rsquo;. A&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0520261054/&#34;&gt; recommended read&lt;/a&gt;.) Norrington has some interesting thoughts on the motivation for searching information on early performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[If] Brahms expected to hear a particular sound, I want to know what that was. Or at least I want to hear it a few times before deciding that it is rubbish. But what I have discovered, all the way from Monteverdi to Mahler, is that when music is played as it should be, the sound is wonderful, the expression is wonderful and the instruments match together.

(...)

[They] are beginning to realise you don&#39;t need to put vibrato on everything, like sugar. I know that I&#39;m still the only conductor that really asks them not to. And that many great musicians simply don&#39;t know why they should even reconsider what they essentially learned in college. But I can&#39;t live without trying to see the skull beneath the skin. In the end, I know this project might still fail, or be shelved for 30 years. So if, on the day I die, the world is playing without vibrato, of course I will be delighted. But even if they aren&#39;t, I&#39;ll still be delighted because at least I did.

&gt; 
&gt; [http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/jul/21/music](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/jul/21/music)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mirrors some of my thoughts about learning how the old milongueros danced back in the day.  I may or may not want to dance exactly like they did, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth giving it a try. Maybe, just maybe, they actually knew something that has gone out of fashion, forgotten by most teachers and considered unimportant by most dancers who &amp;lsquo;just want to dance&amp;rsquo;. There are not many left, but there may still be things to learn from the few milongueros still with us, or from people who studied with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might find that through learning about the idiosyncrasies of a time past, we can discover something that &amp;ndash; even if it is not new &amp;ndash; feels new and refreshing. That by improving our understanding, we can reintroduce the creative act where it seemed lost in new fashions and conformity. That by imposing constraints, paradoxically, we might find freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we need an Early Tango Movement?&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I hear it every so often: that tango technique, especially for women, has gone through a tremendous evolution since the resurgence in the early 1980s. Let&amp;rsquo;s just say I&amp;rsquo;m not quite convinced. Watch this clip from the 1988 movie &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096221/&#34;&gt;Tango Bar&lt;/a&gt;, and draw your own conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday morning brought more sad news from Buenos Aires. It is time to complete the biography of &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2010/02/14/el-turco-jose-brahemcha/&#34;&gt;El &amp;ldquo;Turco&amp;rdquo; José Brahemcha&lt;/a&gt;. Another great milonguero is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had been sick for a while, so in a sense it was no surprise, and we did wonder if we were ever to see him again as we parted for the last time from his apartment in Buenos Aires. That he is gone only a few months later is hard to believe, nevertheless. The memories are still so fresh. José smiling peacefully from his chair. Truly and deeply missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Que en paz descanse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;José Brahemcha (July 7 1931 - April 15 2010)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/jose-bw.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/jose-bw.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;El &#34;Turco&#34; José -- as he is commonly known -- was born in  Buenos Aires, in the neighborhood of  Saavedra, July 17 1931.  He was a dedicated bicycle rider when he was a kid, until his mother (who was a tango singer) suggested that he learn to dance &#34;to get to know some girls&#34;.  At the age of 16, he started to practice with his friends from his neighborhood in the house of one of them, where they had a gramophone player.

They had only one shellac disc with two Pugliese recordings: &#34;La Yumba&#34; on one side, and the milonga &#34;Andá que te cure Lola&#34; on the other.  They were practicing what they remembered from the dance from the movies or what they had seen at the neighborhood dances. When he knew a little, he started to go to the dances and carnivals in the club  &#34;Ausonia Montañeses&#34; in Colegiales.

El Turco worked with wicker, making fine objects like purses. As he wished to learn more dancing, a friend from his work, who already danced, recommended him to go to the practices where people usually learned to dance.  Thus, for some time he went with his uncle in the neighborhood of Martelli to the practices in the clubs, among them the &#34;Huracán&#34; (The hurricane).

The practices were held in the basket courts and they were full of men learning to follow, how to lead, the salida (basic step) and lots of others figures of tango. Later, he returned to the neighborhood of Urquiza, and since he liked that elegant style especially, he studied how &#34;Milonguita&#34; danced in particular, and adapted to his way of dancing.

José&#39;s style can be described as a tango of the floor, with a great variety of original figures and a smooth and elegant way of moving with energy and precision,  the figures always in harmony with the music. Presently he is dedicated to teaching private lessons and group lessons all over the country as well as abroad.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humbly translated by yours truly. This is the original text as posted on  the now defunct website of the Academia de Estilos de Tango Argentino (ACETA):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;El &#34;Turco&#34; José -- como habitualmente se lo conoce -- nació en Buenos Aires, en el barrio de Saavedra, el 17 de julio de 1931. De dedicó desde chico al ciclismo hasta que su madre (que cantaba tangos) le sugiró que aprendiese a bailar &#34;para relacionarse con las chicas&#34;. A los 16 años, junto a los amigos del barrio, empezaron a practicar en la casa de uno de ellos que tenía fonola.

Tenían un solo disco de pasta que conenía dos grabaciones de Pugliese: &#34;La Yumba&#34; de un lado y la milonga &#34;Andá que te cure Lola&#34; del otro. Practicaban según lo que recordaban del baile de alguna película o lo que veían en los bailes de barrio. Ya sabiendo un poco, empezó a frecuentar bailes en los carnavales del club &#34;Ausonia Montañeses&#34; en el barrio de Colegiales.

El Turco trabajó haciendo bomboneras de mimbre y más adelante armando carteras y otros objetos finos en mimbre. Como tenía intención de aprender a bailar más, un amigo de ese trabajo (que ya bailaba) le recomendó ir a las prácticas que en ese entonces se solían hacer. Así que durante algun tiempo frecuentó junto a su tío en Villa Martelli las prácticas que se realizaban en los clubes, entre ellos &#34;Huracán&#34;.

José cuenta que se hacían en las canchas de básket y que estaban repletas de varones aprendiendo a ser llevados, cómo llevar, la marca, la salida, y tantas otras figuras del tango. Más adelante volvió al barrio de Urquiza y gustándole sobre todo ese estilo elegante, estudió en particular el modo de bailar de &#34;Milonguita&#34;, adaptándalo a su manera.

Su estilo puede definirse como un tango al piso, con una gran variedad de figuras originales y un modo de moverse suave y elegante con energía y precisión, armonizando las figuras con la música.  Actualmente se dedica a enseñar en clases particulares y a grupos tanto en el país como en el exterior.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to&lt;a href=&#34;http://jantango.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt; Janis&lt;/a&gt; for saving and sharing it.  As always, I appreciate any contribution to improve the translation. Especially the part about the wicker bombonera (it only rings a bell as the CABJ stadium to me) and the llevados/llevar/marca part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth seminar with José is March 14, so if you are in Bs As at that time, you know what to do&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Essence of Tango</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;When we watched the milongueros dancing years ago, we could perceive the mystery behind what they did, no matter if it was easy or difficult. Therefore, technique has to be understood first, then it can be copied, but the goal is to get to its essence. If you use the word &#34;technique&#34; less in class, and instead use words like &#34;essence&#34; and &#34;sensation&#34;, students can perform the movement with a more natural attitude and will learn faster than if you speak about numbers, diagonals or muscles.

&gt;

&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good advice from the maestros. They also talk about the decline of the European tango scene and our fear of the embrace. Read the &lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/9cYFra&#34;&gt;entire interview at El tangauta&lt;/a&gt; (#184 Feb 2010). [EDIT: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eltangauta.com/nota.asp?id=1438&amp;amp;idedicion=0#nota-mas&#34;&gt;Direct link here&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/QU3zfxcNuHs&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have only one great regret in tango, and that it not taking classes with Gavito. Of course there are others as well, but with Gavito we had the opportunity, we passed, and shame on us for it. Of course, at the time we simply didn&amp;rsquo;t know better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determined not to make same mistake again, we decided to take our teachers&amp;rsquo; advice and try to get in touch with the legendary &amp;lsquo;El Turco&amp;rsquo; José. Master of &amp;lsquo;Estilo Villa Urquiza&amp;rsquo;. I originally thought he did not teach anymore, but in fact Jorge Dispari was hosting a workshop with his old master just days before we arrived in Buenos Aires. Then another one days after we left. Que mala suerte!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were not really planning on taking much lessons at all, but we couldn&amp;rsquo;t just let it go with that, so I got his number, called him up, and made an appointment with his lovely wife. And off we went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will often hear the term maestro of maestros in the tango world. But rarely does it apply as well as with José. In my case, you could say he&amp;rsquo;s the maestro del maestro del maestro..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, he can&amp;rsquo;t dance himself anymore, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop him. When you see how he demonstrates with his feet, caressing the floor like no one else I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, you realize what an amazing dancer is in front of you. Simply a privilege to have the opportunity to learn from such an extraordinary man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things he asked was: Which music do you like to dance to? No hesitation, straight to the core: the music. Whenever I hear the song Cascabelito, I think of José. It was on all three cds we used while practicing on his living room floor. Vargas. Di Sarli. Pugliese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;José is famous for his sublime subtlety, and would not stop until we got it exactly right. We demonstrated. &amp;ndash;No. he would say. Again. &amp;ndash;No. Until we finally got it. &amp;ndash;You have to practice this a lot, he would say. &amp;ndash;Make sure to take notes or film it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;José would sit in his chair, smiling, but with the sharp eyes cultivated to reveal the finer points of tango since he was young, learning to dance mainly by watching the more experienced dancers. We would talk about the tango before and now, and his passion for this dance would lighten his eyes, eager to bring the tango he loves on to new generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the things he showed us were absolutely gorgeous. Yielding very nice sentiments as well as elegance and finesse. The first day we did corrections.&amp;ndash;You want to learn the Villa Urquiza style? he asked. &amp;ndash;Then you cannot do like that. It should be like this. Despacio.. (do it slowly). The last day we did nothing but walking exercises. It will take a lot of practice to internalize it all, but it will be well worth the extra effort. Dancing the tango of José is far from easy. Oh, do I hope there will be more opportunities to learn from this great master again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rare footage of José dancing was published by his daughter Laura on facebook. It is from the Sunday milonga upstairs at Sunderland, organized by the late Lampazo. Jorge Dispari was giving the introduction as well as djing there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jorge Dispari is hosting another class with José in Buenos Aires February 21st.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Marisa Galindo was directing a show in honor of the milongueros, and she is now &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/user/galindomarisa3971&#34;&gt;posting footage from this show on youtube&lt;/a&gt; for all of us to see! The show was filmed on the 16th of October 1991, Homenaje a los Milongueros de Buenos Aires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen fragments of this show before, but didn&amp;rsquo;t know the source, and this seems to be much better quality and I think complete. Truth to be told, I haven&amp;rsquo;t had  time to watch it all yet, but I will, and I will watch it again. And again. And so should you, haha!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tango is full of nostalgia, even sentimentality. We long for the times that were. Even sentimentality was better in the 40s. How can it be for the real milongueros, who were young in that time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to say it is the same, but the thought struck me the other day. I just bought &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.emusic.com/album/The-Prodigy-Invaders-Must-Die-MP3-Download/11373684.html&#34;&gt;the new Prodigy album&lt;/a&gt;, playing it loud and dancing around the kitchen. (I do this a lot, usually to tango music these days) This was the music of my youth, when we went out to party, that was the best. And when we couldn&amp;rsquo;t go out because we were not old enough or didn&amp;rsquo;t have money, we listened to it at home. Longing for the long nights of dancing in a crowd of equal minded. And meeting girls, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like the milongueros had tango. And not much else. It was the music of that time. What you did when you went out and wanted to meet girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thunder! It triggered me to dance! Not tango, though. &lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt; is how electronic dance music sounds today (or rather 10-15 years ago already). Not like that anemic you-know-what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; -I see a lot of men are not dancing. They can&#39;t manage to dance when the floor is so full of people.
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; -It may not be because of lack of ability. It may be because they enjoy the dance more when the floor is not packed and they can more around the floor in their dance. Maybe they are waiting for their favorite music.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One friend commented on me and my wife sitting a lot more in the milongas than we used to after our longest stay in Buenos Aires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do remember the urge to dance every second of the milonga, afraid I might miss something. I do not miss those days. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.limericktango.com/blog/&#34;&gt;Limerick&lt;/a&gt; states this brilliantly in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.limericktango.com/2008/05/of-bulls-young-and-old/&#34;&gt;his post about the two bulls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t it funny how we see so different things, even when watching the exact same event?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://flickr.com/photos/rykerstribe/2589081910/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/eye-of-the-beholder.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;In the eye of the beholder&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember seeing containers all over the place while we were renovating our appartment, a friend who is an architect and carpenter seemed to literally see through the walls in the house before we bought it. A trained art expert will instantly recognize the work of an artist, an analyst will see through the endless rows of numbers in a spreadsheet&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we see people dancing, we notice different things. Where one sees excellent and clear lead, the other sees excessive adornos. Where one sees innovative moves, another sees boring repetition, where one sees old clichés, another sees elegance, musicality and smootheness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe we in many regards see what we are looking for, and what we find familiar. In other words, when we are working on some element in our own dance, we are more likely to see who masters this particular element in other dancers. And easily fail to see other qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, being able to notice excellence in others, requires a certain skill level. To be able to judge musicality, you need to know what is musical. To determine who has the better walk, you need to know how the walk &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be. And so on. It has taken years and months for me to be able to determine by sight whether someone is a good dancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, on occations I have been able to spot a good dancer before she even changed her shoes. I would not say I am able to say exactly what it is that gives a good dancer away, but the way they walk is something I always pay attention to. High heels can be faked. the way you walk in them can&amp;rsquo;t. Only the good dancers got it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, do we see the same walk?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another good documentary about tango. I enjoyed it a lot. Some of the interesting scenes are available on youtube, but the documentary itself was quite hard to get hold of. As far as I could determine, it is not available for sale, not even on ebay, so you better know one of them pirates or use your imagination ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am quite impressed by how ordinary dancers are able to express what tango means to them. I always find it hard to describe what in tango I love so much or why I came to be obsessed with tango.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it made me long for Buenos Aires. A lot. And that hurt. But it was still a good experience, a tango experience I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just read an interview with this year&amp;rsquo;s campeones, Daniel Nacucchio &amp;amp; Cristina Sosa (congratulations, and nice to see Neri &amp;amp; Yanina did well also :-) - Well, he quoted old milonguero wisdom:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;El que menos hace, a veces es el que hace más&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means something like, the one who does less, sometimes is the one that does more. (Forgive my translation, neither Spanish nor English is my native language).  Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: The interview was in the excellent B.A. Tango, which you can subsctribe to by sending an email to  &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:abatango@yahoo.com&#34;&gt;abatango@yahoo.com&lt;/a&gt; with the subject line &amp;ldquo;Suscripción&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
