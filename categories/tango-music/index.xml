      <description>Gabriel Valiente has released a dictionary of Tango which contains discographies of most tango orchestras. It was meant to be released as an ebook, but is only available in paper edition at the moment. I think it looks interesting, but find that kind of information is generally vastly more useful when available electronically, in a format that is searchable and sortable etc. I hope Gabriel finds a way to release the full dataset as well as his book.</description>

Tangohub beat me to it. Head over there for a comprehensive guide to stores for buying tango music online. It&amp;rsquo;s written from a UK perspective, but most of the stores mentioned are international.
I would mention Tangostore also (aka Zival&amp;rsquo;s), but they have been offline for a while.</description>

      <description>The long awaited TangoTunes project website is now online and accepting purchases. I&amp;rsquo;ll start by checking out the few Troilo recordings they have available at the moment. The purchase went through very smoothly.
This is how they present themselves:
TangoTunes is an Austrian-Argentine project with the aim to preserve the music of Tango Argentino. This way, we also preserve and support a piece of Argentine culture, which was declared World Heritage several years ago.</description>

I have previously discussed too fast transfers from 78s. Age Akkerman has a well researched take on Di Sarli&amp;rsquo;s El ciruja which he found to be about 5% too fast on the Euro Records transfer.</description>

      <description>by Paul Graham Raven
The advances in DSP and processing power since I started ripping my cds to store all my music on a computer drive are enormous.
Sometimes having an estimate of the BPM of a tango song can be useful, e.g. when searching for &amp;ldquo;slow&amp;rdquo; milongas, sorting by BPM would be useful. But tapping each song individually to store in tags &amp;ndash; no way it&amp;rsquo;s worth the effort.</description>

      <description>I was pondering the usefulness of noise removal based on several copies of a recording, possibly from different physical copies. A Google search reveals that such a technique is already patented:
The present invention provides a method for reducing noise using a plurality of recording copies. The present invention produces a master file with lower noise than the available recording copies, and avoids the problems of losing musical content caused by prior art pop and click removers.</description>

      <description>The first results are trickling down from the TangoVia project. Tango Tunes is a Vienna based organisation, digitizing music with the help from TangoVia. They recently provided a preview of what they will offer, and I have to say I think it sounds very good. The Troilo sample in particular was very promising. The first songs available for purchase are 100 Biagi songs. The price is EUR 100, which is expensive compared with commercial releases, but cheaper than the Japanese labels.</description>

      <description>by eerkmans
Many CTA discs and others are available in Europe through the Austrian DJ Bernhard Gehberger. He recently went to Japan and met with the guys behind CTA, AMP and Audio Park. From his report from that trip, it seems like he is working on facilitating reissues of these out-of-print discs. Which would be of great benefit to the tango community if he pulls it through. Today they are both hard to get and expensive.</description>

      <description>Danza y Movimiento have released anotherbatch of De Caro collections. In addition to the places they were available the last time, they are also available on Spotify (links below).
I haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to listen carefully yet, but the few I have listened to seem to be transferred at the correct speed (unlike some of the older ones).
Just in time for the upcoming día del tango. Enjoy:

      <description>US readers might be interested that widely acclaimed music service Spotify launches in the US today. And can start listening to the classics of Argentine tango right away. The playlists are mostly complete to the degree that the music is actually available on Spotify.
That&amp;rsquo;s all.

      <description>I sort of promised to post a few samples of my results from slowing down some tracks that I believe are transferred at too high speed in the DyM Tango Classics collection.
Although I have suspected that several other transfers, most notably on the El Bandoneon label were transferred at too high speed, I never tried slowing them down myself because I knew it to be hard to find the correct speed.</description>

      <description>by Todd Binger
I decided to check out the offerings of DyM a bit more closely after I noticed that some of them were available in lossless format from the French site Qobuz. I got a couple of De Caro compilations because they are hard to get by other places. These tracks are mostly from the late 20s and early 30s, so what I found out may or may not apply to other, later recordings issued in this series.</description>

      <description>When were the different tangos recorded? From the 9233 unique recordings identified with exact recording date in the tango.info database we can see that not surprisingly there is low activity during summer, more specifically during January and February, it then picks up with peaks in June, September and December. Splitting the numbers over the decades makes a slightly more confusing picture.
If you want to check out the recordings for one specific date, there is now a nifty feature over at tango.</description>

      <description>I just learnt that the German label Danza y Movimiento (DyM) are issuing a new series called Tango Classics. It is based on the collection of the collector Klaus Johns. There seems to be quite a few tracks not available elsewhere, for instance by Julio De Caro, so it should be worth checking out for all you serious collectors out there :-) Also listed at tango.info.
Unfortunately, they only offer mp3 downloads at the time, flac or some other lossless option would be very nice.</description>

      <description>I believe the only way to come to understand the tango is by listening a lot to tango music. Music appreciation classes are all great, but no substitute for putting in hours and hours of listening. For our beginning classes we have always encouraged our students to start listening to tango music right away. We used to give them a free cd, but while feeling quite ok about this morally, it was a bit on the gray side, legally.</description>

      <description>Tango music was recorded with equipment much inferior to what is available today. Adding to that, the record companies threw away the master&amp;rsquo;s leaving us with reproductions based on the shellac records that further deteriate the sound.
For many of the commercial releases of tango music, the Reliquias series, the 78RPM series etc, the transfers have been cleaned and the noises removed for the music to become more clear and easy to listen to.</description>

      <description>Usually, I don&amp;rsquo;t buy bootlegs, but when it comes to tango music, there is some material that is not available from the commercial releases like Reliquias, Tango Argentino etc. I always concentrated on the commercial releases, but now that I have most of the interesting material from these releases, I have moved on the the more exotic releases, like the Club Tango Argentino by Akihito Baba. They are unfortunately hard to get by, and several are out of print.</description>

After Ignacio Varchausky gave his musicality seminar at theCasa de tango here in Buenos Aires, where the TangoVía project resides, he was kind to show us around the premises and demonstrate the current state of the digital archive.
They have a very nice set of equipment, he showed us the machine they use to clean the discs properly before doing the transfers, the different turntables for different kinds of discs, amplifiers and ADC as well as tape equipment.</description>

The video with most attention (showed by a red bar like in the illustration top centre) is a video showing Jorge Dispari and María &amp;lsquo;La Turca&amp;rsquo; del Carmen at Confitería Ideal. At the time of writing, this video has been viewed 11 852 times.
Youtube describes the calculation of the video &amp;lsquo;hot spots&amp;rsquo; like this: &amp;rdquo;The ups-and-downs of viewership at each moment in your video, compared to videos of similar length.</description>

The punk kids of tango just released another album. It looks like it is called Fernández Fierro, and is available at Zival&amp;rsquo;s/Tangostore. I used to be very enthusiastic about these guys, but after their last release Mucha Mierda (the photo above is from the release party at la Trastienda), I was a bit disappointed, much like Michael Lavocah was. Too harsh, brutal and little variation. But then, that is what they said about D&amp;rsquo;Arienzo in the 30s.</description>

      <description>Golden Age of Tango When was the Golden Age of tango, exactly? It is fairly common to say 1935-1955 mas o menos, but while I was playing around with the data at tango.info, I thought it would be fun to make a plot to **see when the Golden Age was. And here it is. **
These are the number of unique recordings in the database, so if a recording is issued on several cds, it is only counted once.</description>

      <description>Finally somevideos of the new champions. Bear over with the person holding the camera not being able to keep still, and make sure you get the milonga at the end. The Argentine newspaper Clarin has a short interview with them.
I mentioned in a previous post that Japan was important because of the collectors of tango music there, and Royce recently posted several posts (here, here and here [UPDATE: She added part 4, part 5 and part 6] ) on this topic that are well worth a read.</description>

As a nice apropos to the recent discussion I had with Tangocommuter about improvisation in tango, there is an interesting article in the current issue of The New Yorker about the possible return of the improvised cadenza in western art music:
The art of embellishment—improvising cadenzas, adding ornaments, taking other opportunities for creativity in performance—is a hot topic in classical music these days. For generations, conservatories preached absolute fidelity to the score: do what the composer wrote and nothing more.</description>

If youfound the Tango Vía project interesting, there is a full article in the current edition of El Tangauta (No 178). You can get the entire magazine as pdf if you register at their website. All quotes are from English version of the interview in that edition. In addition, there is a lot of interesting reading on the Tango Vía project&amp;rsquo;s web site (in Spanish) about how they do the digital copies.</description>

Man of action. Man of ambition:
[Tango Vía](http://www.tangovia.org/), the organization this tango double-bass player from the famous [Orquesta El Arranque](http://www.orquestaelarranque.com.ar) presides, is up to nothing less than archiving every single tango recording in a super-high definition, archive-grade digital format, following strict technical processing that will drastically enhance the sound quality to make it an almost-perfect match to the pristine original.   [Buenos Aires Herald](http://buenosairesherald.com/PrintedEdition/View/4262)    Wonder how we could help them succeed with this project, arranging some sort of fund raiser or something?</description>

Just as I was seriously considering quitting eMusic for good &amp;ndash; they deleted my plan, essentially making it more expensive, after I forgot using my credits in time, they just added a load of tango albums, making it somewhat tempting to stay a while longer anyways. Several of the &amp;lsquo;Grandes del Tango&amp;rsquo; albums published by Lantower were recently added and also some others. They also changed it so you can buy an entire album for 12 credits, which works out well for tango albums often with 20+ songs.</description>

Niño Bien has always been one of my favorite milongas, and when I found the picture I used for illustration of my post on organizing a milonga, I was reminded that, unlike the photographer, I have never been there early, before the milonga really starts. For some reason, we always arrive late..
&amp;hellip;and possibly stay late. Although not often so late as to hear the dj put on La Cumparsita, the tango often used to round off the night at Buenos Aires milongas.</description>

Una vez, tocando con una pequeña orquesta en la escuela de música popular -- eran estudiantes; yo me sentí, tocando con ellos, me sentí cómodo. Pero físicamente cómodo, como cuando uno se siente con la ropa de entrecasa. Y dije: &#34;¿Que me pasa? Y de pronto, la orquesta estaba tocando, esa orquesta de la escuela en un concierto y salen a bailar algunas personas. Y yo ví eso y dije: &#34;</description>

Some songs are more popular than others, and some are harder to find than others. Sometimes you have to buy an entire disc full of songs you already have to get just that song. So my library of tango music has a lot of duplicates. And more, is there a word like elevenicates?
So the most popular songs are probably available on a lot of records, I figured, and out of curiosity, I checked which were the most popular in my collection, this is for all songs that I have the recording date (from tango.</description>

      <description>Imagine a tango orchestra of really young and talented musicians, forming a small orquesta típica with members ranging from the age of 10-14. Three bandoneóns, three violins, double bass and piano. Playing tango, and not only Piazzolla. Playing together for several years to get the music under their skin. Where would this happen if not in Buenos Aires?
In Norway! In a cold small town in the middle of nowhere, or in the heart of Norway as some would say.</description>

Tango music for the non-argentine 21st century tango lover is often something of an acquired taste. At least for tango dancers. The recordings are old, the music sounds strange, we don&amp;rsquo;t understand the lyrics &amp;ndash; but we love the dance&amp;hellip;
After some time, we get more into the music, it all changes, and we become total fanáticos de tango, we can never get enough of the classics of tango music.</description>
