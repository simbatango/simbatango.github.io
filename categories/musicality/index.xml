      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Losestilos.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Losestilos.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Losestilos&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignacio Varchausky is doing a series of very interesting seminars on the style of different tango orchestras. Audio recordings of the seminars have been released with links in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/events/873463526054939/&#34;&gt;the facebook comments&lt;/a&gt;, and that means an opportunity to listen to them even when very lejos de Buenos Aires. They are in Spanish though, so you need to follow spoken Spanish reasonably well to make any use of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, they build on a seminar similar to the one that inspired &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2009/12/19/what-to-listen-for-in-tango/&#34;&gt;this post on how to listen to tango&lt;/a&gt;, so you might want to check out that first, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already. There is one seminar dedicated to a single orchestra and what characterizes their style. Highly recommended. Obviously, if you&amp;rsquo;re in Buenos Aires on September 16, you should go to Centro Cultural Lola Mora at 7 PM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignacio encourages sharing these in one of the seminars, because the purpose of the seminars is to spread knowledge of tango. Of course, this is right up my alley, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist. All the original download links can be found in the comments of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/events/873463526054939/&#34;&gt;facebook event&lt;/a&gt;, but some of them will expire and some are very large files. Therefore, I host some more reasonably sized versions below (~50-100 MB each, choose between &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Advanced_Audio_Coding&#34;&gt;AAC&lt;/a&gt;/m4a or slightly smaller &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Opus&#34;&gt;Opus&lt;/a&gt; versions):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy! ¡Espero que los disfruten!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mickey Mousing</title>
      <link>https://simbatango.github.io/2010/06/02/mickey-mousing/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2010 19:47:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>simbatango@gmail.com (Simba)</author>
      <guid>https://simbatango.github.io/2010/06/02/mickey-mousing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mickey.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mickey.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to be spreading, a new way of interpreting music in tango. Every so often I hear people rave about some couple&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;outstanding musicality&lt;/em&gt; and more often than not it translates to their mimicking every little plink and plonk in the music with a corresponding movement.  Naturally, it requires good knowledge of the song to do this, but does it really demonstrate such great musicality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once heard this way of dancing called &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mousing&#34;&gt;Mickey Mousing&lt;/a&gt;, as it was like this music was often used in animations, many from the 1930s and the 1940s. Except, of course the musicians put on the music to follow the cartoons, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to note that the wikipedia page says: &amp;ldquo;Frequently used in the 1930s and 1940s, especially by Max Steiner, it is somewhat discredited today, at least in serious films, because of overuse.&amp;rdquo; As this thechnique was much used at the prime time of tango, it is also interesting to see that this overuse was pointed out already in the 1940s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For some reason, many cartoon musicians are more concerned with exact synchronization or &#34;mickey-mousing&#34; than with the originality of their contribution or the variety of their arrangement. To be sure, many of the cartoons as they reach the musician are something less than inspirational, but most of them even the best, gain less than they should from this contribution.

&gt; 
&gt; _[Hollywood Quarterly, Vol 1, No 4 (Jul. 1946), p 365](http://www.jstor.org/pss/1209496)_
&gt; 
&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less inspirational, indeed. While I do find for instance Chicho&amp;rsquo;s dance extremely musical at its best, there are &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2010/01/22/what-does-it-mean-to-dance-with-good-musicality/&#34;&gt;so many aspects of music and musicality&lt;/a&gt;, that going mainly for the Mickey Mousing is somehow one-dimentional, and when other people try to repeat Chicho&amp;rsquo;s feat, it easily gets totally uninteresting, at least to me. At times I also get the feeling that the dancers are &amp;lsquo;too clever&amp;rsquo;, and not conveying any emotional content corresponding with the music I hear. It was thrilling the first time, maybe, but it is an effect that should be used with care, like all effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to argue that someone else&amp;rsquo;s musical interpretation is &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/strong&gt;, but if it differs too much from your own, it is hard to connect to what they are doing. It gets distracting, and it feels like they are not even listening to the music, which is ironic when in this particular case they are working so hard to match it perfectly. That goes for performances as well as social dancing. Instead of chasing the music, trying to match every instant of it, let go and wait. Let the music move you, then take control and make it yours. Don&amp;rsquo;t rush it. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you miss a plink. It&amp;rsquo;s your dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make an impact, be it with the audience or with our partner, we need to share a common understanding of the music, finding its substance together. All the effects in the world cannot compensate for a lack of substance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tango dancers often discuss the importance of dancing to the music, having &amp;lsquo;good musicality&amp;rsquo; etc.  But what exactly does it mean to dance musically? I tried noting some possibilities, and since some are very basic, while other are more advanced (and should be used sparingly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to classify them within the usual trichotomy of beginner/intermediate/advanced, thinking that you have to know the very basics, and you should master basically everything in the intermediate before venturing out into the advanced concepts. Some of the advanced concepts should be used with care, such as stepping on the weak beat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;very-basics&#34;&gt;Very basics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dancing when there is music and not when there is not (yes, really)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stepping on the (strong)beat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make your partner step on the (strong) beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(be able to)Dance double time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make pauses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dance tango to tango music, milonga to milonga and vals to vals (etc)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;intermediate&#34;&gt;Intermediate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation of the emotional content of the music (e.g. humorous, sad, tragic, romantic etc)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walk to music with strong walking beat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dance to the phrasing of the music&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dancing the pauses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dance smoother to smooth music, more rhythmically to rhythmic music etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading one rhythm while doing another&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Match something in the music with particular step or ornament&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dance the final variation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predict the end of a song and close in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cadencia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;advanced&#34;&gt;Advanced&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step on the weak beat (and not on the strong)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving counter to the music (e.g. slow down when the music is fast)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Play with rhythms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fit sequences of steps with the phrases of the music&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeat and make variations when the music repeats with variations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syncopated steps (e.g. suspension or anticipation) that fits the music&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something extra :-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If you have to ask, you will never know.

&gt; 
&gt; _Luis Armstrong when asked &#39;what is jazz?&#39;_
&gt; 
&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;You see, that is not the way to make it &amp;lsquo;swing&amp;rsquo; in tango.&lt;/em&gt; I was looking out onto the group of people standing around us with question marks painted all over their faces. &amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Well, I don&amp;rsquo;t know the right word, but the corresponding to swing in tango.&lt;/em&gt; They were bouncing up and down for each step, like in many other dances; swing and folk dance were probably what they had been somewhat exposed to before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&amp;ndash;You make it swing by changing the weight, but staying in the same level. _I explained and demonstrated, knowing it was really a crude simplification. It was not the time to start talking of phrasing and movements of upper body, but I think they got the idea. The caricature of what they were doing made them smile&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what would be a good word for it? Cadencia? Canyengue? Tango? &lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;You see, to make it &lt;strong&gt;tango&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; Nah..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been said about tango that your feet dance the rhythm, while your body dances the melody. Which is well put, I think. It is fascinating this constrast between the hastily moving, intertwining legs, playing games while the upper bodies are calm in a loving embrace. This contrast is essential to the dance&amp;rsquo;s almost hypnotical attraction on the spectators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing the dancers flowing around the dance floor, the music arriving in waves. And the dancers surfing on these waves. Breathing with the phrases Doing their thing. Not rushing it. Not controlled by it, but somehow following it nevertheless. While the feet go ric-tic-tic-tic-tic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is the essence of the cadencia, I think. This flowing motion of the bodies. Waves, pendulums. Rising and falling. Apparently cadencia comes from Latin and means fall, so I could be on to something here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With many foreign dancers (like myself), the dance will appear and feel a little stiff (duro) or flat (chato). A perfomance can be very good in the sense that it is well coordinated, dancers always in balance, synchonized and moving to the right place in every step. Flawless. Still there will be something missing. And what is missing, I believe often to be the cadencia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once did a variant of a simple backstep that I learned from a milonguero with a friend at a practica. She looked at me, horrified, and said: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;It felt almost like we were falling.&lt;/em&gt; Well, that was the point&amp;hellip; Falling safely in my embrace. Feeling the cadencia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact one of the best compliments you could possibly get is to be told that you have cadencia by someone who knows what it&amp;rsquo;s about. Not that I suggest that I really know. Well, at least I am trying. And I write this despite the fact that it may be the proof that I will never get it, I have this sneaky feeling that it is with tango as it is with jazz. If you have to ask&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tango is full of nostalgia, even sentimentality. We long for the times that were. Even sentimentality was better in the 40s. How can it be for the real milongueros, who were young in that time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to say it is the same, but the thought struck me the other day. I just bought &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.emusic.com/album/The-Prodigy-Invaders-Must-Die-MP3-Download/11373684.html&#34;&gt;the new Prodigy album&lt;/a&gt;, playing it loud and dancing around the kitchen. (I do this a lot, usually to tango music these days) This was the music of my youth, when we went out to party, that was the best. And when we couldn&amp;rsquo;t go out because we were not old enough or didn&amp;rsquo;t have money, we listened to it at home. Longing for the long nights of dancing in a crowd of equal minded. And meeting girls, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like the milongueros had tango. And not much else. It was the music of that time. What you did when you went out and wanted to meet girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thunder! It triggered me to dance! Not tango, though. &lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt; is how electronic dance music sounds today (or rather 10-15 years ago already). Not like that anemic you-know-what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ah -- you dance **real** milonga (echte Milonga).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After struggling with my milonga for years, this was the ultimate sign I was finally getting somewhere. And one of my favorite compliments ever. I got a tip from the Argentine host to ask this woman to dance, he thought I should dance with someone good. So I did. And was not disappointed. Starting almost right out with a milonga, which would have terrified me only a year earlier. I used to make sure never to dance milonga with someone unknown to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three months in Buenos Aires working on my milonga more or less every day, practicing the rhythm while brushing my teeth, almost being thrown off the roof by Javier because I did so bad; It made a difference. And not only to the milonga. I think my tango changed to the better as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways the milonga is the crux of the tango, so few know how to do it well. So often you see people dancing &lt;em&gt;fast tango&lt;/em&gt; to milonga music. Which is not the same by far. The milonga appears to be simple, but is not. It is very subtle, and understanding the music is harder, it is not just about the speed. Many of the best milongas aren&amp;rsquo;t that fast, actually. It is about subtle timing, syncopes and clarity. All of which are also needed in tango, but the lack of them is more easily revealed in the milonga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember we had some friends participating in the 2007 campeonato metropoletano, and is was so much easier to tell the good from the mediocre in milonga. So to find the good dancers, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to watch their milonga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who hasn&amp;rsquo;t been tempted&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; to do some flashy moves when someone sitting next to the dance floor watches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; to show all the tricks of the trade when getting to dance with a really good dancer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; to play some obscure gem from the record collection when djing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; to  play some &lt;insert non-tango genre here&gt; music to be innovative&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, it does not impress anyone. Least of all the ones you try to impress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is just annoying. I am not impressed when you do a jump on the floor of a milonga, I have to make an effort not to start laughing (yes &amp;ndash; this happened). I am not impressed when you play Madonna (this too), just irritated that I have to wait 15 more minutes until there is a slight chance of getting some danceable music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dj that plays great dance music all night long without directing attention to himself. A performance of pure excellent movement in harmony with the music, both letting the other shine. Now &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; is impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tango music for the non-argentine 21st century tango lover is often something of an acquired taste. At least for tango dancers. The recordings are old, the music sounds strange, we don&amp;rsquo;t understand the lyrics &amp;ndash; but we love the dance&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some time, we get more into the music, it all changes, and we become total fanáticos de tango, we can never get enough of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://tejastango.com/classic_tangos.html&#34;&gt;classics of tango music&lt;/a&gt;. Why do we never get tired of listening to these old recordings, often transferred from old, scratchy 78s, since &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.totango.net/rca.html&#34;&gt;the masters were burnt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will often hear tango lovers rave about the &lt;em&gt;complexity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;richness&lt;/em&gt; of tango music. So let us investigate a bit further what is the source of this richness. The title of the first record by the orchestra Escuela de tango, &lt;em&gt;De contrapunto&lt;/em&gt; gives us the first clue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to categorize music is by the musical textures, and the three main categories are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monopohonic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homophonic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polyphonic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophony&#34;&gt;Monophonic&lt;/a&gt; music consists of a single melody line, and is the simplest form of musical texture. Perhaps the best known example in western music is the Gregorian chant. The monophonic music is also the easiest to understand or interpret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophony&#34;&gt;Homophonic&lt;/a&gt; music is slightly more complex, as it consists of a principal melody line accompanied by a chordal accompaniment. Perhaps a bit surprisingly, it is the most recent &amp;ldquo;invention&amp;rdquo;, as it basically did not occur in music created earlier than the end of the 16th century. It was used in a lot of romantic music for increased clarity and thus emotional impact, in contrast with the most complex form, polyphony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony&#34;&gt;Polyphonic&lt;/a&gt; music is the kind that is the most demanding of the listener. Several melodic lines, or &amp;ldquo;voices&amp;rdquo;, are present at the same time, forming harmonies as they go. To appreciate this, you may have to disregard some parts of the music, and the melodic line (horizontal) will become apparent. This gives a different listening experience than &amp;ldquo;just listening&amp;rdquo; to all the sounds present at the same time (vertical). Depending on which lines you choose, the same piece may be experienced somewhat differently each time. And this is what is actually meant when dancers talk about dancing to different instruments. All voices need not be present at the same time, of course, and some melodic lines will move from instrument to instrument, so dancing different voices would be a more precise definition of what you are actually doing. (The clue from de contrapunto is that &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint&#34;&gt;counterpoint&lt;/a&gt; is one special case of polyphonic music)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote Aaron Copland in the book &lt;em&gt;What to listen for in music&lt;/em&gt; (on which this post leans heavily),  &amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;repeated hearings keep up your interest better than music of homophonic texture. Even supposing that you do not hear all the separate voices equally well, there is every likelihood that when you return to it again, there will be something different for you to listen to. You can always hear it from a different angle.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pop music springs out from the homophonic tradition from the romantic music. While being popular music, tango from the golden age has a certain quality that you will not generally find in today&amp;rsquo;s popular music, the polyphony. And that also explains why it is much less interesting to dance to pop music than the real stuff. It is simply not enough to throw in some bandoneón samples or having more or less the right rhythm. More on that in a later post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The polyphonic nature of most tango music means there are a lot of ways to listen to the same tune, you can discover something new time after time. And it makes the music sound fresh every time. And thus the dance stays fresh as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Technique vs. Feeling</title>

&lt;p&gt;Which one is most important? Technique or dancing with feeling? I sometimes get the impression that tango dancers are divided in two camps, the technique camp and the feelings camp. The first emphasizes the technical matters of the dance, the latter paying solely attention to the feeling. As long as we can hug each other, all is well ;-) Both seemingly ignoring the other point of view completely. As a matter of fact, I used to get a little annoyed by people who dismissed technique and just wanted to be in the embrace, feeeeeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By what interests me nowadays, I can easily be mistaken for belonging in the feelings camp. I find the technical extravaganzas of many performances quite boring at times, as they convey no emotional content whatsoever (to me, that is). So have I moved to the other camp?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not really, I would rather say I belong in the both are necessary camp. I just  heard an interview on the radio with a conductor visiting one of the major symphony orchestras here, and he made the following statement about the two leading violinists in the orchestra (quoted as I remember it):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;They have very good technique, which allows them to express their musicality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is at the heart of the matter. You need good technique. You need it to express your musicality through your dance. You should work hard to improve it, but technique alone will not do. It is a necessary condition, but hardly sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just as the music critics rather discuss the interpretation of an orchestra or musician, I think the artistic interpretation is more interesting to discuss than the technical points. Technique is simple, really: all you need is good teachers and a lot of practice&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t it funny how we see so different things, even when watching the exact same event?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://flickr.com/photos/rykerstribe/2589081910/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/eye-of-the-beholder.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;In the eye of the beholder&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember seeing containers all over the place while we were renovating our appartment, a friend who is an architect and carpenter seemed to literally see through the walls in the house before we bought it. A trained art expert will instantly recognize the work of an artist, an analyst will see through the endless rows of numbers in a spreadsheet&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we see people dancing, we notice different things. Where one sees excellent and clear lead, the other sees excessive adornos. Where one sees innovative moves, another sees boring repetition, where one sees old clichés, another sees elegance, musicality and smootheness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe we in many regards see what we are looking for, and what we find familiar. In other words, when we are working on some element in our own dance, we are more likely to see who masters this particular element in other dancers. And easily fail to see other qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, being able to notice excellence in others, requires a certain skill level. To be able to judge musicality, you need to know what is musical. To determine who has the better walk, you need to know how the walk &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be. And so on. It has taken years and months for me to be able to determine by sight whether someone is a good dancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, on occations I have been able to spot a good dancer before she even changed her shoes. I would not say I am able to say exactly what it is that gives a good dancer away, but the way they walk is something I always pay attention to. High heels can be faked. the way you walk in them can&amp;rsquo;t. Only the good dancers got it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, do we see the same walk?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another good documentary about tango. I enjoyed it a lot. Some of the interesting scenes are available on youtube, but the documentary itself was quite hard to get hold of. As far as I could determine, it is not available for sale, not even on ebay, so you better know one of them pirates or use your imagination ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am quite impressed by how ordinary dancers are able to express what tango means to them. I always find it hard to describe what in tango I love so much or why I came to be obsessed with tango.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it made me long for Buenos Aires. A lot. And that hurt. But it was still a good experience, a tango experience I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
