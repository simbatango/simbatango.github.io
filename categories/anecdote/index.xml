 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There she was, the girl with the blue dress. I noticed here before, but I never managed to catch her eye. Her seat was all the way over at the other corner, so I started walking between the tables. As I approached slowly, I tried to establish eye contact. She changed her position. A slight turn of the head. I got closer. She looked down. Opened her purse. I walked on until I passed her and continued to the Men&amp;rsquo;s room. Refused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some days later, I was back in the same milonga. There she was. This time closer to my table, sitting with her girlfriend, whom I had also noticed before. Fortunately, her friend accepted my invitation. I met her at the corner of  the wonderful parquet dance floor as the place started to get really packed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked her back to the table with the frozen blue dress and returned to my own. From the corner of my eye, I watched the two of them discussing vividly, glancing over in my direction. The moment of truth. Too bad I would not hear the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Di Sarli intrumental. I scanned the crowd for a suitable partner. Two eyes met mine. With a subtle nod, the contract was written and I walked towards the table. The blue dress got up and we headed for the dance floor. Hora Pica &amp;ndash; peak hour &amp;ndash; and no other option than keeping it simple. Walking in an embrace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Random meetings with strangers in the night. Most are quickly forgotten. Others stay with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several years later, on a different continent. There is something familiar with that girl. I walk over to her table to say hello. She remembers. She goes dancing with some other guy while I chat with a mutual friend.  Then she returns. Di Sarli Instrumental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our eyes meet again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Tango Hustle</title>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;So&amp;hellip; what are &lt;strong&gt;these guys up to?&lt;/strong&gt; There I was, attending my very first tango festival. I did not know very much about tango, but I did know enough to notice this couple. They were dancing, but they were doing something quite different&amp;hellip; Different indeed. Yet there was something tangoish over it. Not quite ballroom tango, not quite Argentine tango, still a hint of tango.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only watching Saturday Night Fever probably years later, did I realize: What they had been doing was the &lt;strong&gt;tango hustle&lt;/strong&gt;. According to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hustle_(dance)&#34;&gt;Wikipedia Hustle entry&lt;/a&gt;, the tango hustle was in fact invented by the crew for this scene. You can watch a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/index.jsp?cid=294904&#34;&gt;clip from Saturday Night Fever with the tango hustle&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the opening walk of John Travolta in the very same movie is a must see if you need an illustration of how much can be in &amp;ldquo;just walking&amp;rdquo;. But you don&amp;rsquo;t need that, do you?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Whiskey Tango Foxtrot</title>

&lt;p&gt;I was dancing a nice tanda with a friend of a friend, and while it was not exactly my favorite music, we were doing fine. We were having a good time. There were lots of people dancing, nobody got hurt, and we were dancing peacefully among the other couples. So far so good&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciated the festival organizers&amp;rsquo; effort to give some extra credit to the djs. I belive they wanted to send a message. But as much as I love that the art of djing is seen as more important than it used to on the northern hemisphere, there is a flip side to it.  They had hired one of the most famous djs in Europe at the time, probably the most famous. He should know what he was doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it happened. I sensed something was wrong. This was several years back, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t instantly recognize it, but there was something strange with the music. It didn&amp;rsquo;t inspire. It didn&amp;rsquo;t fit in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t tango.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dj was being clever. He had played a tango which has some kind of train imitating sounds, much like you find in some blues tunes. Funny. Why not match it with another song with similar sound?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it is a foxtrot, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello!? We are dancing tango, and you throw in a foxtrot? W.. T.. F..?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dutifully finishing the tanda, I went for the exit. Completely threw me off the flow. On the way out, I saw the dj waving to the crowd, the crowd returned the gesture, doing the wave in return. I shivered, and went alone out in the rain, leaving my last festival behind.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Not so easy</title>

&lt;p&gt;A teacher and his former student, on his first trip to Buenos Aires, run into each other outside La Glorieta and starts to chat. Suddenly the student bursts out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;**A:** (about the music) This is milonga, right?

**S: **No, this is tango.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation is drawing to an end, as the teacher is heading home. They talk for another minute, until the next song of the tanda starts and the student is eager to dance more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;**A: **Well, I think I have to go and dance a little milonga....

**S: **(!)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teacher watches him walk back to the pavillion, turns around, picks up his young son, and dances into the darkness as Fiorentino sings the last words of &lt;em&gt;Toda mi vída&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

Each involves a young woman, at the age where going to parties and flirting with alcohol is at its most exciting, somewhere just before or just after going to university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#1: A rather simple red wine was served with the main dish at a dinner party with the entire class of that year. She tasted it, called for the waiter and asked for another bottle. &amp;ndash;This I cannot drink. Only thing was, there was nothing wrong with the wine. Except that is was cheap. And the new bottle of the same, cheap wine was no better, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#2: At a party in the place of a friend&amp;rsquo;s parents, she opened the bottle, poured into a glass and tasted. Then she walked right over to the sink and &amp;ndash; to the astonished looks from her friends &amp;ndash; emptied the entire bottle into the sink.  &amp;ndash;This I cannot drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How this applies to tango is left as an exercise to the reader&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Almost perfect</title>
      <link>http://simbatango.com/2009/08/17/almost-perfect/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuckincustoms/3037394506/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3234/3037394506_61bff229a4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Anyone care for a dance? by Stuck in Customs, on Flickr&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/2.0/80x15.png&#34; alt=&#34;Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 2.0 Generic License&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/people/stuckincustoms/&#34;&gt; Stuck in Customs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imagecodr.org/&#34;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my first tanda in the milongas with her. In the break between two dances at the legendary milonga at Club Sunderland, I was chatting with la preciosa, who later became one of my dearest tango friends. She asked me if I knew who was dancing (the exhibition) that night, and I confirmed, that yes, of course I knew. It was the very reason I went there that night, in fact. I praised his elegance and skill (I had yet to see or meet his new partner). Yes, she sighed, he is **almost **perfect. I smiled. If someone would be close to perfect, it would be him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talked to her later about this remark, and how good it was, then she would say no, no, he is perfect. Still, I liked the idea. No tango dancer is really &amp;lsquo;perfect&amp;rsquo;. We all dance our own way. There is no official standard, luckily the tango in the Argentine tradition has remained rich in variation and ways of expression. Becoming perfect is unachievable, yet we never give up trying. Sometimes you will get touched by a gleam of light of perfection, and go after it. If you dare. But clearly, some get much closer to perfection than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once at a guided tour of a castle, the guide told us about the marvelous floor in the dancing hall, and how much effort was put into making it so beautiful for the king that resided there. Yet - he said - the craftsmen put in a deliberate mistake. They knew the danger of hybris, and were in no position to make it &amp;lsquo;perfect&amp;rsquo;. Almost perfect, yes. Perfect, no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And after taking lessons with this incredible dancer, the same humbleness with respect to the tango is very striking. No bragging, no easy solution. Simply extremely good teaching. He definitely transformed my dancing. To the better, that is ;-). Through his teaching and his dancing, he reveals great respect for the tango and for the milongueros. And for the women in tango.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some dancers can get &amp;lsquo;too perfect&amp;rsquo;. Everything is right, still something is missing. Never miss a beat, always in balance, gancho here, boleo there, &amp;hellip;two three four, finale and bow to the applause. An element of humanity missing, of emotion, opening up to one&amp;rsquo;s partner, lowering the armor, showing a little vulnerability. &lt;strong&gt;That&lt;/strong&gt; is what moves me. So in this sense, almost perfect is much to prefer to &amp;lsquo;perfect&amp;rsquo; if you understand what I mean. Which is why I loved her comment so much. Simple, yet profound. As is his tango.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>La Cumparsita</title>

&lt;p&gt;Niño Bien has always been one of my favorite milongas, and when I found the picture I used for illustration of my post on organizing a milonga, I was reminded that, unlike the photographer, I have never been there early, before the milonga really starts. For some reason, we always arrive late..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and possibly stay late. Although not often so late as to hear the dj put on La Cumparsita, the tango often used to round off the night at Buenos Aires milongas. At Niño Bien, Mario Orlando was playing and like he usually does, played energetic tangos towards the end of the night, to squeeze out the last drop of the guests before they head home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On came a cumparsita so powerful and energetic I had never heard before. While the waiters were cleaning the tables, new waves of energy were bursting over the dance floor, the different instruments taking turns in leading on the next heave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a night!
What an ending!
What a cumparsita!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way out, we stopped by to ask Mario which orchestra he played last. It was Donato Racciatti. Guess who went right to Zival&amp;rsquo;s the next day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will never be the same as this first time though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;--Do you know why the Chileans love tango?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have made a couple of Chilean friends lately, and that means opportunities to practice my castellano. In all countries, the residents make jokes about their neighbours, and one of my new friends told me this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another invited us to his asado (or bbq as they say here), and kept insisting on me saying** **&lt;strong&gt;tu&lt;/strong&gt;, not &lt;strong&gt;vos&lt;/strong&gt; like in Argentina. I, on the other hand, was always dreaming of speaking Spanish with an Argentine accent, so I kept my vos, thankyouverymuch. Even if he admitted the meat they used was Argentinian, he also claimed the Chileans made much better asados than the Argentines. In lack of any Argentines there, he was constantly picking on me. It was like that all night, quite amusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;--Because in every tango, at least one Argentine suffers or dies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking the dance of tango down to its smallest parts is a popular exercise. Why stop at forward-side-back-steps? What it really comes down to is one simple concept. If you can do it, you can tango. Or at least you need to be able to do it to dance it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standing on one leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a week-end class, we had one student with some condition that made it impossible for her to stand on one leg. Which was sad because the communication did not work at all. I was sorry to realize that she would never be able to dance tango, even if she really wanted to. We did our best to make it work and for her to have a good time, of course,  but it was quite clear that tango was not for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may seem all too obvious to write a blogpost about, no? Well, there is a more subtle point I wanted to make. The best dancers have a clarity and elegance, simplicity of movement that we all long for (I suppose). And to a large degree it stems from their ability to stand on exactly one leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No less, no more&amp;hellip; ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simba found a new cage. It has the most lovely hardwood floor. Parquet. Yum-ba! We&amp;rsquo;ll see how much milongas there will be in the new town, but Simba already started patrolling the new territory with enrosques and paradas thrown in here and there. And it is smooooth! So at least some private dancing inside the cave, while guarding the offspring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must admit floors mean a lot more to me after dancing tango for a while than they did before. I remember going to my first tango festival, and the more experienced dancers were discussing the quality of the floors in the different venues. ¿Que? A floor is a floor is a floor, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not so, some are soft, some are hard, smooth, slippy. Some are actually adding significantly to the dancing experience. Like the floor at Canning. Wow! A lot of nice places have terrible floors, though, so it&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; important, but I get all giggly inside whenever I step onto the floor at Canning. Sigh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tango is full of nostalgia, even sentimentality. We long for the times that were. Even sentimentality was better in the 40s. How can it be for the real milongueros, who were young in that time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to say it is the same, but the thought struck me the other day. I just bought &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.emusic.com/album/The-Prodigy-Invaders-Must-Die-MP3-Download/11373684.html&#34;&gt;the new Prodigy album&lt;/a&gt;, playing it loud and dancing around the kitchen. (I do this a lot, usually to tango music these days) This was the music of my youth, when we went out to party, that was the best. And when we couldn&amp;rsquo;t go out because we were not old enough or didn&amp;rsquo;t have money, we listened to it at home. Longing for the long nights of dancing in a crowd of equal minded. And meeting girls, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like the milongueros had tango. And not much else. It was the music of that time. What you did when you went out and wanted to meet girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thunder! It triggered me to dance! Not tango, though. &lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt; is how electronic dance music sounds today (or rather 10-15 years ago already). Not like that anemic you-know-what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privates can be tough. Very useful, but tough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our first trip to Buenos Aires, my wife and I took privates with Julio &amp;amp; Corina, and we worked on the basics. Of course. We learnt a lot, but it was so much to think about. So much we did wrong. So much to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my own sake, it felt like they deconstructed my whole body, just to leave the parts on the floor. For me to pick up and bring back for the next lesson. I felt like I could not dance at all for about a week. (Which was maybe not so far from the truth, as I had not really been dancing for that long.) Even at the prácticas, I felt out of place, unable to relax and enjoy the dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took some time to reassemble, but it was definitely worth the effort. In reaching the next level, one&amp;rsquo;s awareness of the things that need to be fixed, can give some headache, but when you finally get there, it really improves your dancing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general feeling has been repeated with various other teachers over the years, but with more experience it takes less effort to put myself together after groundbraking changes. Well &amp;ndash; maybe not less effort. But it breaks me down for a shorter time. And I am better prepared in advance. Maybe the errors I have to fix are not as grave as they used to be. I like to think of it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/2.0/80x15.png&#34; alt=&#34;Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic License&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/people/alyssathiele/&#34;&gt; alyssathiele&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imagecodr.org/&#34;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tango cliché of dancing with a rose in the mouth is quite fascinating. It is everywhere, and everybody doing argentine tango wants &lt;em&gt;absolutely nothing to do with it&lt;/em&gt;. But where does it come from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have often seen it associated with the silent movie star Rudolph Valentino, and suggested that it first appeared in the movie &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0012190/&#34;&gt;Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (1921). So being curious, I had to check this out. Which was not so easy, as the Four Horsemen was not easily obtainable on DVD. Until I one day found out it was published as a bonus disc on the Valentino documentary &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Rudolph-Valentino-Great-Lover-Documentary/dp/B000EGDCGO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=dvd&amp;amp;qid=1230081144&amp;amp;sr=8-2&#34;&gt;The Great Lover&lt;/a&gt; (The documentary turned out to be quite interesting as well, leading to more Valentino movies for me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most famous scene from The Four Horsemen is when the young hero in the film dances tango in a bar in La Boca. This scene is quite interesting, and while not exactly correct, the tango in this scene is much better than what people usually associate with Hollywood tango in general and with Valentino&amp;rsquo;s tango in particular. Just don&amp;rsquo;t try those sacadas with spores on&amp;hellip;   But no rose in mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a scene from Paris, where our hero dances tango in a much more sober fashion. And a scene involving a rose, but nobody ever puts it into anyone&amp;rsquo;s mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/vlcsnap-503547.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/vlcsnap-503547.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where does the rose and the Hollywood cliché then come from? It is certainly established in the Hollywood comedy _&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053291/&#34;&gt;Some Like it Hot&lt;/a&gt;__ (1959)_&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; and Tom Lehrer sings about it in his song _Masochism Tango. _Both of these also suffer from a severe mix-up with flamenco, featuring castanets, which to my knowledge has never been used in Argentine tango. Possibly the flamenco &lt;em&gt;tangos&lt;/em&gt; have something to do with the mix up, or perhaps the rule that Argentines had to perform in gaucho costumes in Paris in the early 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/vlcsnap-505672.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/vlcsnap-505672.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter another Valentino movie. Featuring flamenco, a whip, a bullfighter, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;a rose in the mouth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;_. _The movie is &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0012952/&#34;&gt;Blood And Sand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (1924), and Valentino plays the matador, the bullfighter. It features a scene where a woman puts a rose in her mouth after doing a flamenco. So this cliché probably stems from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who first mixed the two together I have no idea, but I can&amp;rsquo;t say I think it is fair to blame it all on Valentino.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buenos Aires is not like home. And when in Rome, drive like the Romans&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Argentines kiss when they meet. Better get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;(...) would lean over, ready to commit the act that, I thought, was reserved only for girlfriends and, on occasion, family.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guy used a few months it seems, but has written a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.roadjunky.com/article/12/man-kiss-argentina&#34;&gt;really entertaining account of the argentinian kissing habits&lt;/a&gt;. With special attention to male kissing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia also has &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek_kissing&#34;&gt;rich coverage of the topic&lt;/a&gt;, and the Freakonomics blog wonders &lt;a href=&#34;http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/09/who-changes-the-kissing-rules/&#34;&gt;how kissing rules change&lt;/a&gt;. Who decides?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up north, where I live, people are generally very afraid of touching other persons, unless part of the closer circle as the quote mentions. Which makes it kind of hard to to learn how to dance tango. &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2008/11/22/cheek-to-cheek/&#34;&gt;Cheek to cheek&lt;/a&gt;, as it is supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, we have used the exotic Argentine greeting habits in class to break the ice. We had everybody greet each other &amp;ldquo;the Argentinian way&amp;rdquo;. People hesitated at first, but as they moved around the circle (everybody greeting all potential partners), the tension gradually receded, and they ended up less afraid to touch each other, and possibly also remembered a few names. A nice start for their tango career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ah -- you dance **real** milonga (echte Milonga).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After struggling with my milonga for years, this was the ultimate sign I was finally getting somewhere. And one of my favorite compliments ever. I got a tip from the Argentine host to ask this woman to dance, he thought I should dance with someone good. So I did. And was not disappointed. Starting almost right out with a milonga, which would have terrified me only a year earlier. I used to make sure never to dance milonga with someone unknown to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three months in Buenos Aires working on my milonga more or less every day, practicing the rhythm while brushing my teeth, almost being thrown off the roof by Javier because I did so bad; It made a difference. And not only to the milonga. I think my tango changed to the better as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways the milonga is the crux of the tango, so few know how to do it well. So often you see people dancing &lt;em&gt;fast tango&lt;/em&gt; to milonga music. Which is not the same by far. The milonga appears to be simple, but is not. It is very subtle, and understanding the music is harder, it is not just about the speed. Many of the best milongas aren&amp;rsquo;t that fast, actually. It is about subtle timing, syncopes and clarity. All of which are also needed in tango, but the lack of them is more easily revealed in the milonga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember we had some friends participating in the 2007 campeonato metropoletano, and is was so much easier to tell the good from the mediocre in milonga. So to find the good dancers, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to watch their milonga.&lt;/p&gt;
