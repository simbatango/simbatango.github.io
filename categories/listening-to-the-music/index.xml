      <description>Ignacio Varchausky is doing a series of very interesting seminars on the style of different tango orchestras. Audio recordings of the seminars have been released with links in the facebook comments, and that means an opportunity to listen to them even when very lejos de Buenos Aires. They are in Spanish though, so you need to follow spoken Spanish reasonably well to make any use of it.
Apparently, they build on a seminar similar to the one that inspired this post on how to listen to tango, so you might want to check out that first, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already.</description>

Not much time to write at the moment, here are some interesting posts that you might enjoy that I want to keep track of for later for my own sake:
Interesting interview with Chicho Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3
Quite an interesting read. I could relate very well to his comments on why teachers don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily dance all the time at festivals. Apparently many people in my local community have difficulties understanding this.</description>

      <description>You know more about music than you think. You start picking up the rules from the day you are born, yes even before. And part of what makes music enjoyable is this knowledge of what to expect and the delight when your expectations are fulfilled, or some times bent a little before they find resolution.
This is part of the message of a fascinating book about music, The Music Instinct by Philip Ball, (read reviews for instance in The Economist, or in The Guardian) a book that I finally had time to finish reading this week-end.</description>

Knowing what to listen for can greatly improve how much you appreciate music. I had the opportunity to attend a workshop with Ignacio Varchausky on listening to tango music. It was very interesting, and it turned out that it corresponded with a post I was planning to write as soon as I got back to my copy of Aaron Copland&amp;rsquo;s What to listen for in music.</description>

A teacher and his former student, on his first trip to Buenos Aires, run into each other outside La Glorieta and starts to chat. Suddenly the student bursts out:
**A:** (about the music) This is milonga, right? **S: **No, this is tango. The conversation is drawing to an end, as the teacher is heading home. They talk for another minute, until the next song of the tanda starts and the student is eager to dance more:</description>

      <description>As I was uploading a couple of new videos at youtube, I noticed the &amp;lsquo;Attention&amp;rsquo; ranking of my videos in the &amp;lsquo;Insights&amp;rsquo; section. The video with most attention (showed by a red bar like in the illustration top centre) is a video showing Jorge Dispari and María &amp;lsquo;La Turca&amp;rsquo; del Carmen at Confitería Ideal. At the time of writing, this video has been viewed 11 852 times.
Youtube describes the calculation of the video &amp;lsquo;hot spots&amp;rsquo; like this: &amp;rdquo;The ups-and-downs of viewership at each moment in your video, compared to videos of similar length.</description>

If you prefer your naïve, pure emotional interpretation of the tango, you might not want to read this. If, on the other hand you think that knowing a little about how tango music is organized might increase the breadth or depth of your musical appreciation, then this could be for you.
Like Tangocommuter writes in the discussion of how a tango became approximately three minutes long, a prototypical tango has the structure ABA:</description>

Ms Hedgehog is researching the dynamics of flow in the ronda, comparing with traffic and pondering about the importance of song length.
While song length can probably have some influence, I believe other factors are much more significant. And it is kind of hard to perform real experiments, even though she deserves credit for the attempt.
According to Jorge Dispari, the flow on the dance floors of Buenos Aires used to be much better than today.</description>

   -I see a lot of men are not dancing. They can&#39;t manage to dance when the floor is so full of people.     -It may not be because of lack of ability. It may be because they enjoy the dance more when the floor is not packed and they can more around the floor in their dance. Maybe they are waiting for their favorite music.</description>

My previous post got me going on the habit that some dancers have of talking while dancing.
Just stop it, ok?
How can you possibly be listening to the music when you are talking at the same time? The conversation is going on in the dance, remember? And even if you somehow manage to do both at the same time, you are disturbing the others on the floor.</description>
