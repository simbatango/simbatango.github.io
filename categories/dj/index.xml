      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Losestilos.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Losestilos.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Losestilos&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignacio Varchausky is doing a series of very interesting seminars on the style of different tango orchestras. Audio recordings of the seminars have been released with links in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/events/873463526054939/&#34;&gt;the facebook comments&lt;/a&gt;, and that means an opportunity to listen to them even when very lejos de Buenos Aires. They are in Spanish though, so you need to follow spoken Spanish reasonably well to make any use of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, they build on a seminar similar to the one that inspired &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2009/12/19/what-to-listen-for-in-tango/&#34;&gt;this post on how to listen to tango&lt;/a&gt;, so you might want to check out that first, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already. There is one seminar dedicated to a single orchestra and what characterizes their style. Highly recommended. Obviously, if you&amp;rsquo;re in Buenos Aires on September 16, you should go to Centro Cultural Lola Mora at 7 PM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignacio encourages sharing these in one of the seminars, because the purpose of the seminars is to spread knowledge of tango. Of course, this is right up my alley, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist. All the original download links can be found in the comments of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/events/873463526054939/&#34;&gt;facebook event&lt;/a&gt;, but some of them will expire and some are very large files. Therefore, I host some more reasonably sized versions below (~50-100 MB each, choose between &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Advanced_Audio_Coding&#34;&gt;AAC&lt;/a&gt;/m4a or slightly smaller &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Opus&#34;&gt;Opus&lt;/a&gt; versions):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy! ¡Espero que los disfruten!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/altuwa/4154974726/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2774/4154974726_c58eaa2db3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Daft Punks DJ Cover Set - Northampton, M by sebastien.barre, on Flickr&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thrilled to see the increased interest in djing and playing quality tango music for dancers the last few years. In trying to understand how it all came about, it is tempting to focus on the efforts of individuals to bring good dance music to their local community, but thereby we might miss the big  picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technological and economic changes can be transformative. Some of the most famous examples from the world of tango are the invention of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction#Electrical_recording&#34;&gt;electrical recorder&lt;/a&gt;/the microphone, the fierce competition between orchestras during the golden age of tango and the selective pressure following from men largely outnumbering women in the milongas as the dance developed. Without these environmental factors, tango, (and many other cultural expressions for that sake) would quite possibly have developed very differently. The inventions that have transformed the activity of tango djing, and thus the milongas and dancing in general all over the world, are incarnated in a single object: the laptop computer. However, there are several related technologies that became available and/or cheap enough at the same time: portable computers, (lossy) audio compression, and communication over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a dinosaur like me started out, making tanda sets on writable cds, computers generally did not have a cd-rw drive, and very few people had access to  portable computers. (Although I feel tango-old sometimes, my djing doesn&amp;rsquo;t go back to the use of cassettes like &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2014/09/02/felix-picherna-tengo-una-pregunta-para-vos/&#34;&gt;Felix Picherna&lt;/a&gt;). That didn&amp;rsquo;t last long. Suddenly you could fit the selection of tangos that you would need for a milonga on a portable computer, using mp3 files. Information on how to dj could be shared over the internet. Even music files could be shared over the internet or among friends using portable disks. While I spent years building up even a basic cd collection of tango music, involving visits to Argentina and cumbersome mail ordering with lots and lots of red tape, I was almost shocked the first time I heard someone discuss how he just copied the entire music collection of another dj to help him start out as a dj.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as other technological and economical change, this may have made life more difficult for the already established djs. The upside was that it became incredibly much easier for everybody else, and it generally led to more varied and over time to better music selection in the milongas around the world, at the very least in smaller communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As more and more people got access to the tango classics, the dj fanatics would dig out unknown jewels from various sources, or replace their beloved tracks with higher quality transfers to differentiate themselves from the crowd. Soon some of the &amp;lsquo;new&amp;rsquo; songs became hits, and djs all over widened their selection. There is a flip side to this too, of course. Some songs get overplayed for a while, and some djs get carried away by the collector&amp;rsquo;s syndrome, trying to impress their fellow dancers with obscure, undanceble tracks (that really sounds like a good idea to impress dancers, right?). All in all that seems like a small problem compared to how overplayed a lot of music was when the selection was more  limited. Some djs consistently play crap, of course, but even they are often an improvement from playing the one available cd from El Bandoneón on repeat. The one which skips in the same place every time you play it. And with lower barriers to entry comes increased variety and competition. The dancers could simply move to the next dj that played nice tango music and leave the crap for an empty floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today a beginner dancer or dj can start playing quality tango music from Spotify instantly that would take ages and cost a fortune to collect just 10-15 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when djs that were a bit ahead of the curve think back to the time it felt like an endless walk in the desert trying to get the local tango community up to speed music wise: it turns out it was just the sea pulling back in the instant before the tsunami hit.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Felix Picherna is a legend, and he was clearly the first tango dj to make a lasting impression in me. Sitting with his cassette deck, rewinding the prepared tandas, live commenting the upcoming music with the microphone. Unforgettable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy this video from the excellent &amp;ldquo;Tengo una pregunta para vos&amp;rdquo; series by Pepa Palazón, that I just recently found time to start watching. There are several gems there, and the most recent ones are subtitled in English (that includes this one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also really enjoyed the ones with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju2LRV3BymI&#34;&gt;Vanina Bilous&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHajO2jYxMw&#34;&gt;Olga Besio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aphw2EmiQTU&#34;&gt;Guillermina Quiroga&lt;/a&gt;, and I still have quite a few to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tangohub.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Tangohub&lt;/a&gt; beat me to it. Head over there for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tangohub.co.uk/2013/05/where-to-buy-your-tango-music/&#34;&gt;comprehensive guide to stores for buying tango music&lt;/a&gt; online. It&amp;rsquo;s written from a UK perspective, but most of the stores mentioned are international.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would mention &lt;a href=&#34;http://tangostore.com/&#34;&gt;Tangostore&lt;/a&gt; also (aka Zival&amp;rsquo;s), but they have been offline for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long awaited &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tangotunes.com&#34;&gt;TangoTunes project website is now online&lt;/a&gt; and accepting purchases. I&amp;rsquo;ll start by checking out the few Troilo recordings they have available at the moment. The purchase went through very smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how they present themselves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;TangoTunes is an Austrian-Argentine project with the aim to preserve the music of Tango Argentino. This way, we also preserve and support a piece of Argentine culture, which was declared World Heritage several years ago.

In cooperation with TangoVia Buenos Aires we promote the project &#34;Tango Digital Archive&#34; with the goal to archive the recordings and documents of Tango Argentino in their entirety.

TangoTunes purchases selected collections of vinyl and shellac records from collectors in Argentina and digitizes them in a highly difficult process. Since the beginning of 2013, approximately 1.000 vinyl records and 5.000 shellac records are successively being digitized with precision and care. We offer these Tango recordings – our „tunes“ – to Tango lovers in our online store. Our product catalog is constantly expanding – it pays off to have a look more frequently!

Founded in 2013, TangoTunes is a young company located in Vienna, Austria and a branch in Buenos Aires, Argentina. We spend much time and care to restore the music of Tango Argentino as close to the original as possible. This not only requires much know-how and experience, but also great appreciation for the original and tenacious work for an ideal final result.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advances in DSP and processing power since I started ripping my cds to store all my music on a computer drive are enormous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes having an estimate of the BPM of a tango song can be useful, e.g. when searching for &amp;ldquo;slow&amp;rdquo; milongas, sorting by BPM would be useful. But tapping each song individually to store in tags &amp;ndash; no way it&amp;rsquo;s worth the effort. I remember doing some experiments years and years ago with automatic BPM calculation, and the results were useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, on the other hand, there are open source solutions available. The one I tried got good results, better than I could achieve manually, I think. I used Sonic Annotator with a vamp plugin from Queen Mary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/sonic-annotator/files&#34;&gt;http://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/sonic-annotator/files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The command line I used was this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; ./sonic-annotator -d vamp:qm-vamp-plugins:qm-tempotracker:tempo -w csv --csv-stdout ../test.wav
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I did a small script to calculate for my collection. I probably should have used different parameters for vals and milonga, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the time to try this out (it is already a long time since I did this, trying to cope with the blog post drafts queue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;TMP=$HOME/vamp/tmp.wav
flac -d &amp;quot;$1&amp;quot; -f -o &amp;quot;$TMP&amp;quot; 2&amp;gt;/dev/null
BPM=$(sonic-annotator -d vamp:qm-vamp-plugins:qm-tempotracker:tempo -w csv --csv-stdout &amp;quot;$TMP&amp;quot; 2&amp;gt;/dev/null |head -n 1 |cut -d&amp;quot;,&amp;quot; -f3)
metaflac --remove-tag=BPM &amp;quot;$1&amp;quot;
metaflac --set-tag=BPM=$BPM &amp;quot;$1&amp;quot;
rm &amp;quot;$TMP&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Sonic Visualiser I could have the software play along the detected beats to see if the timing was ok. Depending on your sense of humour, this could be a funny version of what seems to be my favourite test track: &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/al-verla-pasar-kick.mp3&#34;&gt;Al verla pasar + kick drum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Audio Restoration from Multiple Copies</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/SprBroMorSapICASSP13-figure1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/SprBroMorSapICASSP13-figure1.png&#34; alt=&#34;SprBroMorSapICASSP13-figure&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pondering the usefulness of noise removal based on several copies of a recording, possibly from different physical copies. A Google search reveals that such a technique is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/patents/US5740146&#34;&gt;already patented&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The present invention provides a method for reducing noise using a plurality of recording copies. The present invention produces a master file with lower noise than the available recording copies, and avoids the problems of losing musical content caused by prior art pop and click removers. The system comprises a recording playback unit, a computer system with a sound input capability, and a high capacity storage system such as a CD recorder. In operation, a plurality of recording copies of a single recording are played on the playback unit. These recordings are digitized by the computer and a separate recording file is formed for each copy of the recording. The recording files are then synchronized. The samples from each of the recording files are then averaged to reduce the noise components. A variety of threshold comparison techniques can be employed to eliminate samples and/or recording files that are outside of a computed range for that sample.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing a little more research I found the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~simond/match/index.html&#34;&gt;MATCH&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/doc/tutorial/en/sv-alignment.pdf&#34;&gt;plugin for Sonic Visualiser&lt;/a&gt;, which sort of does what I had in mind, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out how to process the aligned audio to get two aligned files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method is described in a 2005 &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~simond/pub/2005/dafx05.pdf&#34;&gt;paper by Simon Dixon&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dynamic time warping ﬁnds the optimal alignment of two time series, but it is not suitable for on-line applications because it requires complete knowledge of both series before the alignment can be computed. Further, the quadratic time and space requirements are limiting factors even for off-line systems. We present a novel on-line time warping algorithm which has linear time and space costs, and performs incremental alignment of two series as one is received in real time. This algorithm is applied to the alignment of audio signals in order to follow musical performances of arbitrary length. Each frame of audio is represented by a positive spectral difference vector, emphasising note onsets. The system was tested on various test sets, including recordings of 22 pianists playing music by Chopin, where the average alignment error was 59ms (median 20ms). We demonstrate one application of the system: the analysis and visualisation of musical expression in real time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found&lt;a href=&#34;http://vista.eng.tau.ac.il/publications/SprBroMorSapICASSP13.pdf&#34;&gt; another paper by Pablo Sprechmann, Alex Bronstein, Jean-Michel Morel and Guillermo Sapiro&lt;/a&gt; who seem to do exactly what I had in mind. This is fresh stuff, and I found no reference to any available software implementation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A method for removing impulse noise from audio signals by fusing multiple copies of the same recording is introduced in this paper. The proposed algorithm exploits the fact that while in general multiple copies of a given recording are available, all sharing the same master, most degradations in audio signals are record-dependent. Our method ﬁrst seeks for the optimal non-rigid alignment of the signals that is robust to the presence of sparse outliers with arbitrary magnitude. Unlike previous approaches, we simultaneously ﬁnd the optimal alignment of the signals and impulsive degradation. This is obtained via continuous dynamic time warping computed solving an Eikonal equation. We propose to use our approach in the derivative domain, reconstructing the signal by solving an inverse problem that resembles the Poisson image editing technique. The proposed framework is here illustrated and tested in the restoration of old gramophone recordings showing promising results; however, it can be used in other applications where different copies of the signal of interest are available and the degradations are copy-dependent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you happen to be in Vancouver in the end of May, you can attend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.icassp2013.com/Papers/ViewPapers.asp?PaperNum=4586&#34;&gt;their presentation at ICASSP 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m curious as to how much difference this would make in practice compared with traditional statistical approaches. Theoretically, it would be very interesting for getting the most out of tango recordings where the masters are long gone and  would reduce less man hours for manual restoration. However, it would require extra effort as each track would have to be digitized from multiple physical copies, not to mention that you would need access to more than one physical copy of each recording. Something to think of for a project like&lt;a href=&#34;http://tangovia.org/&#34;&gt; TangoVia&lt;/a&gt;, that multiple copies of the same material might actually be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tango Tunes</title>
      <link>http://simbatango.com/2013/02/20/tango-tunes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/BIAGI_5621_A.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/BIAGI_5621_A.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;BIAGI_5621_A&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first results are trickling down from the TangoVia project. Tango Tunes is a Vienna based organisation, digitizing music with the help from TangoVia. They recently provided a preview of what they will offer, and I have to say I think it sounds very good. The Troilo sample in particular was very promising. The first songs available for purchase are &lt;a href=&#34;http://de.tangowiki.com/index.php/Biagi_100&#34;&gt;100 Biagi songs&lt;/a&gt;.  The price is EUR 100, which is expensive compared with commercial releases, but cheaper than the Japanese labels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it comes down to then is selection and transfer quality. The really great thing is that they will offer lossless files in high resolution (96 kHz, 24 bit) for those that have time to spend restoring music. We others can just downsample to 44.1kHz, 16 bit. Unfortunately, Biagi is not high on my prioriy when it comes to repurchasing tango music. The commercial releases are already ok quality. Troilo on the other hand, will put me first in line. Same goes for De Caro, and probably also Di Sarli. D&amp;rsquo;Arienzo will also be interesting for many DJs, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how they plan on rolling this out later, but making complete discographies available would be another thing to make them stand out. I&amp;rsquo;m crossing my fingers for complete Troilo later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many CTA discs and others &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tango-dj.at/contact/order.htm&#34;&gt;are available in Europe&lt;/a&gt; through the Austrian DJ &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tango-dj.at/contact/contact.htm&#34;&gt;Bernhard Gehberger&lt;/a&gt;. He recently went to Japan and met with the guys behind CTA, AMP and Audio Park. From &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tango-dj.at/reports/japan2012.htm&#34;&gt;his report from that trip&lt;/a&gt;, it seems like he is working on facilitating reissues of these out-of-print discs. Which would be of great benefit to the tango community if he pulls it through. Today they are both hard to get and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck, Bernhard!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of restoring from a disk crash, I am moving to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tango.info/wiki/TINT-based_filing&#34;&gt;TINT based filing&lt;/a&gt;, which is a neat way to sort out duplicates, and useful if you want to share playlists or just make sure your playlists will keep working in the future. However it is not very convenient when you want to browse your file system for a particular file or album, in that case you need to use an application which reads the tags of the audio files or an inclination to remember barcodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that I browse my files for specific music a lot, as part of the user experience of my Squeezebox setup (my preference for tango music, not the only option). I&amp;rsquo;ve been aware of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pytagsfs.org/&#34;&gt;pytagsfs&lt;/a&gt; project for a while, and this prompted me to finally give it a spin. It seems to work quite well, and at least for the time being that will be the setup on my server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two things caused me a bit of head scratching, though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One has to enable allow_other for fuse in /etc/fuse.conf and set read permissions for that file allowing the user mounting the pytagsfs to read it. Without allow_other, the squeezeboxserver would not be allowed to see the virtual file system, neatly organized by artist, album and title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;pytagsfs does not support tags containing slashes (obvious in retrospect, took me a while to figure out), and in my first attempts lots of files simply didn&amp;rsquo;t show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it works just fine with the following options (tint based files in directory tint and the new mount point is tango):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ pytagsfs -o allow_other -o format=&#39;%?%{artistsort}%:%{artist}%?/%?%{catalognumber} %?%{album}/%?%{TRACKNUMBER} %?%{title}.%{extension}&#39; ../tint/ tango/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can think of a few other use cases that could be useful, too, for example if you&amp;rsquo;re happy with your current layout but want the TINT filing for canonical playlists, you should be able to do something like the following (I did not test this):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ pytagsfs -o allow_other -o format=&#39;%{TIN}/%{discnumber}/%{tracknumber}.%{extension} tango-dir/ tint-dir/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could list all albums from a series, list songs alphabetically or chronologically by artist etc. I have been thinking about a nice way to combine files from different trees, some which are processed and some that are originals  with the srcfilter option, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t really had time to work it out yet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Too Fast Transfers</title>
      <link>http://simbatango.com/2011/06/15/too-fast-transfers/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/raza-criolla.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/raza-criolla.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sort of promised to post a few samples of my results from slowing down some tracks that &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2011/05/07/dym-online-tango-classics/&#34;&gt;I believe are transferred at too high speed in the DyM Tango Classics collection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I have suspected that several other transfers, most notably on the El Bandoneon label were transferred at too high speed, I never tried slowing them down myself because I knew it to be hard to find the correct speed. Maybe impossible. To know you got the right signal (as in as similar or undistorted relative to how it sounded before it entered the recording chain), you would have to know the tone played at some time during the recording, and how the instrument that played that tone was tuned. Even though there are scores for many tangos, the exact arrangements are rarely available, and even then you would have to know that the musicians did not deviate from what was written there (e.g. transposing up or down a (semi)tone). And how the instrument was tuned. Most commonly the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_pitch&#34;&gt;concert pitch&lt;/a&gt; A is supposed to be 440 Hz, but it has varied from time to time and from orchestra to orchestra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not trivial in other words as I basically had access to exactly none of the required information. I usually tried to get another and hopefully more correct transfer, leaving the problem to be sorted out by someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now with some of these De Caro recordings, it was just too annoying, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t know of any other transfers available (which was why I got them in the first place). So I gave it a try. As I don&amp;rsquo;t have perfect pitch and didn&amp;rsquo;t have the above mentioned information, I did it by trial and error, and I paid particular attention to the timbre of the piano, attack, decay etc and generally tried to assess whether it sounded &amp;lsquo;right&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be interested to hear your opinion, here are two examples, both by Julio De Caro, El taita/Raza criolla and Maipo. First original as transferred by DyM, then my 7 percent slowed down versions (about one semitone). EDIT: I added some samples for tracks that I believe are not so readily available: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tango.info/04024236200191-1-7&#34;&gt;Berretín&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tango.info/04024236200498-1-4&#34;&gt;Lorenzo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music mastered at different levels can be a pain when you&amp;rsquo;re a dj, as well as when listening to music at home. The great differences in loudness levels is in part due to what is sometimes called the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war&#34;&gt;Loudness War&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, but sometimes it is just inconsistent between different issuers. As long as you listen to a CD/compilation as it was designed from the issuer, there is no problem, it is when you start mixing tracks from different sources that the volume starts jumping up and down&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have used &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=Replay_Gain&#34;&gt;ReplayGain&lt;/a&gt; to adjust automatically to a target volume level, and it has served me well. It&amp;rsquo;s not perfect, though, so I read with great interest about efforts to create tools to implement the &lt;a href=&#34;http://tech.ebu.ch/loudness&#34;&gt;EBU R128 standard&lt;/a&gt; which is supposedly a better technology for achieving basically the same goal. ReplayGain works very well within music with more or less the same sonic spectrum in my experience, but tended to play modern recordings with lots of bass louder than older music like golden age tango music to pick a completely random example. This would even be noticeable between early and late Di Sarli for instance, not that I would play them together in the same tanda, but just to give you an idea. Much better than random jumping up and down, but with room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two projects were announced at approximately the same time, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=85978&amp;amp;mode=linearplus&#34;&gt;R128gain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=86116&amp;amp;mode=linearplus&#34;&gt;libebur128&lt;/a&gt;. I did a little testing with libebur128, and the preliminary results are very promising. I now got my music collection basically converted to using R128 in place of ReplayGain. I also compared the gain values generated with ReplayGain and R128, and it verified my impression that typical pop music will be played back at lower volume, relatively, than before, and typical golden age tango material will be played louder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tag my main collection, which resides on a Linux box, I used a small bash script to recursively tag all flac files directory by directory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/bin/bash
find . -type d|
while read dir; do
./r128-sndfile -t ./rgtag.py &amp;quot;$dir/&amp;quot;*.flac
done
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assumes you got the r128-sndfile executable in the directory you need to tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: There is now a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_r128scan&#34;&gt;foobar2000 scanner available&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: The new version of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.foobar2000.org/&#34;&gt;foobar2000&lt;/a&gt; (1.1.6) incorporates the libebur128 library for scanning of replaygain values. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jiixyj/libebur128&#34;&gt;Libebur128 is now hosted at github&lt;/a&gt; The new version (0.4) does not use the python script anymore, and supports recursive tagging natively.&lt;/p&gt;
