      <description>Clearly, they got something out of all these body mechanics workshops&amp;hellip;
There is something about the fluffy prose of the tango advertising that is either funny or tragic. Maybe both. Why is it that the ones teaching &amp;lsquo;quality of movement&amp;rsquo; have nothing of the sort? What exactly is &amp;lsquo;organic tango&amp;rsquo;? (Tango Voice does a great job in dissecting that term). What about &amp;lsquo;body mechanics&amp;rsquo;? Apparently these are often used together.</description>

There seems to be a common misunderstanding that you are not supposed to use your arms when dancing tango.
That is wrong on so many levels. I can see where it comes from, as it is a common mistake among beginners to do try leading with their hands, and not using the rest of their bodies. But one thing is to make point to beginners and quite another to elevate it to a universal truth.</description>

I had a laugh when I read this part by MovementInvitesMovement. In their wonderful, provocative style, they wrote an entire post about something that I hinted at in a comment in my post about clothes and tango.
Some hard core dancers would say that if it gets too warm with the jacket on, you are waisting energy ![;-)](http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif) When my beloved wife read that, her immediate reaction was: hard core dancers?</description>

So what&amp;rsquo;s with this marathon thing that seems to be spreading across Europe? I never found anything positive about marathons, running and sweating for hours on asphalt with no break and being totally destroyed afterwards?
Of course, people may dance as they like. Myself, I prefer a nice milonga, champagne at the table, nice and clean clothes, nice and calm. Having a ball. Walking.</description>
