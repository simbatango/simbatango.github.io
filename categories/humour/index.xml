      <description>This is a long term favorite, no wonder people have the freakiest ideas about us tango dancers&amp;hellip; It should clear up once and for all, that dancing tango is not any fun.
I never knew much about Tom Lehrer, though. I recommend this excellent BuzzFeed piece on Tom Lehrer, in addition to checking out his other oevre of course. It has generally aged pretty well.</description>

      <description>This is a great idea! Trouvez l&amp;rsquo;erreur! from Les Pas Parfaits de Montréal. Simple, funny and well executed. Drawings by Véronique Paquette. My French is a bit rusty, but I believe the drawings are free to use for non-commercial purposes, and that it is allowed to translate them and incorporate translations in the images.
Makes me want to go to Montréal!</description>

      <description>I some times muse over the multiple levels of nostalgia in tango. Today we are (at least to some degree) nostalgic about the golden age of tango, peaking in the 1940s. Tango, of course, was already nostalgic about the turn of the century during the golden age.
Now, I always thought of this as layered or maybe even recursive nostalgia, beging nostalgic about the nostalgia of the 1940s. Add the nostalgia being a long way from Buenos Aires and longing back to being nostalgic about how they were nostalgic about the fin de ciecle in the golden age, and you get the picture&amp;hellip; Even the nostalgia was better in the old days.</description>

From the product pages:
   Either it’s after work, while studying or on a hung-over Sunday morning, this is a garment with a real statement: - Who cares!    This has got to be the ultimate subversive fashion.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a little late to post about tango and football, they have been playing for a week already in the World Cup. I deejayed on the opening night and made sure to play a couple of football-related songs, Independiente Club and Racing Club. Don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone noticed though. Since I&amp;rsquo;m not really into football, I sort of cheer for Argentina, and they are doing well so far.</description>

Time to upgrade my deejaying slogan. While I still sort of like the tongue in cheek fluffy deejay advertisment in-joke of **Keine komische Musik, **it has several problems. It is in German, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really translate well. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure people get the joke, they may not even understand German. Also it may come off a bit negative. I would prefer a more positive note, so to speak.</description>

The feminine in the masculine subconscious (Anima) and the masculine in the female subconscious (Animus), and the complementary in the two archetypal sides. Tango (...) exudes passion, pride, love and attraction (...) Take pleasure in the dance (...) Not about a class or show, but about salt and pepper mills.</description>

A teacher and his former student, on his first trip to Buenos Aires, run into each other outside La Glorieta and starts to chat. Suddenly the student bursts out:
**A:** (about the music) This is milonga, right? **S: **No, this is tango. The conversation is drawing to an end, as the teacher is heading home. They talk for another minute, until the next song of the tanda starts and the student is eager to dance more:</description>

      <description>Did you check your list twice? This is old, but I saved it for Christmas time. Not really related to tango, except we were introduced to it by tango people. In spring. My wife&amp;rsquo;s pregnancy was just becoming official, and the unborn baby instantly earned his first nickname: Jorgito. &amp;ndash;But don&amp;rsquo;t name him Jorgito, that&amp;rsquo;s not nice.</description>

      <description>Eye contact. According to American Airlines. Funny coincidence I saw this ad just a couple of days before we left for Buenos Aires, as we were flying AA. The photo is taken in San Telmo if I am not mistaken.
Does this mean AA know the cabeceo?
They canceled our flight, by the way, and the car seat did not fit in the seat, and they put us in the very back, so I can&amp;rsquo;t say we were very happy with them, hence no temptation to think it was destiny or anything&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>**Jim used to wonder** why he never enjoyed dancing---why he hesitated whenever he asked a friend to be his partner. One evening when he was trying to make up his mind to ask a very charming young lady to dance, he suddenly realized that if his dancing were more modern... he would get more enjoyment out of life. Jim took a few lessons at the Arthur Murray Studios. Today he is not only an excellent dancer, but he has also gained poise and confidence.</description>

      <description>Old but good: tango (the dance) is used to sell musical forms that may have little in common with tango. These examples show that cliches can be treated elegantly and with humour. Not to say that the dancing is necessarily very elegant&amp;hellip;
My favorite: the Van Damage. The gotan one is quite cool, too.

      <description>Apropos good neighbours, the Argentines are apparently constantly quarreling with the Uruguayans about things tango related. Given that La cumparsita was composed by an Uruguayan and the birth place of Gardel is still a matter of discussion.
So here is an example of the excellent tango uruguayo, presented by the eminent Walter and Waldo. Hilarious.

      <description>by?Simba tango
There was a discussion on the tango dj mailing list a while ago about people wanting &amp;ldquo;stuff without the stuff&amp;rdquo;. In other words, tango (dance) without tango (music). An oxymoron, one would think.
Stephen Brown put it so well with his little story:
   A number of years ago, I was in a coffee shop that offered coffee prepared many different ways. One of the ways was decaffeinated coffee with artificial sweetener and artificial cream.</description>

I just heard this story, and found it hilarious, about a dancer complaining to the dj. The conversation went something like this:
-Ur music sux, man! -Allriiiight... which song would you like me to play? -! -Just name one song you would like me to play... -!! -Sooo... you don&#39;t actually know any songs, do you... Needless to say; before complaing, you ought to know what you are talking about.</description>

I was warned once in a milonga in Central Europe: We have to dance **now, **this is milonga, he won&amp;rsquo;t play much of it. Later there will only be _komische Musik _(comical music).
This is the best excuse I have ever heard for asking someone (me) to dance! And she was right. The dj had no clue whatsoever and played a lot of &amp;ndash; well, komische Musik.</description>

      <description>Just because tango can be deep and serious, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it can&amp;rsquo;t be a lot of fun, too.
