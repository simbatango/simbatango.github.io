&lt;p&gt;A new documentary on tango singers Alberto Podestá and Juan Carlos Godoy by Daniel Tonelli and Marcelo Turrisi looks interesting. Hope it gets released on dvd or video on demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thrilled to see the increased interest in djing and playing quality tango music for dancers the last few years. In trying to understand how it all came about, it is tempting to focus on the efforts of individuals to bring good dance music to their local community, but thereby we might miss the big  picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technological and economic changes can be transformative. Some of the most famous examples from the world of tango are the invention of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction#Electrical_recording&#34;&gt;electrical recorder&lt;/a&gt;/the microphone, the fierce competition between orchestras during the golden age of tango and the selective pressure following from men largely outnumbering women in the milongas as the dance developed. Without these environmental factors, tango, (and many other cultural expressions for that sake) would quite possibly have developed very differently. The inventions that have transformed the activity of tango djing, and thus the milongas and dancing in general all over the world, are incarnated in a single object: the laptop computer. However, there are several related technologies that became available and/or cheap enough at the same time: portable computers, (lossy) audio compression, and communication over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a dinosaur like me started out, making tanda sets on writable cds, computers generally did not have a cd-rw drive, and very few people had access to  portable computers. (Although I feel tango-old sometimes, my djing doesn&amp;rsquo;t go back to the use of cassettes like &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2014/09/02/felix-picherna-tengo-una-pregunta-para-vos/&#34;&gt;Felix Picherna&lt;/a&gt;). That didn&amp;rsquo;t last long. Suddenly you could fit the selection of tangos that you would need for a milonga on a portable computer, using mp3 files. Information on how to dj could be shared over the internet. Even music files could be shared over the internet or among friends using portable disks. While I spent years building up even a basic cd collection of tango music, involving visits to Argentina and cumbersome mail ordering with lots and lots of red tape, I was almost shocked the first time I heard someone discuss how he just copied the entire music collection of another dj to help him start out as a dj.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as other technological and economical change, this may have made life more difficult for the already established djs. The upside was that it became incredibly much easier for everybody else, and it generally led to more varied and over time to better music selection in the milongas around the world, at the very least in smaller communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As more and more people got access to the tango classics, the dj fanatics would dig out unknown jewels from various sources, or replace their beloved tracks with higher quality transfers to differentiate themselves from the crowd. Soon some of the &amp;lsquo;new&amp;rsquo; songs became hits, and djs all over widened their selection. There is a flip side to this too, of course. Some songs get overplayed for a while, and some djs get carried away by the collector&amp;rsquo;s syndrome, trying to impress their fellow dancers with obscure, undanceble tracks (that really sounds like a good idea to impress dancers, right?). All in all that seems like a small problem compared to how overplayed a lot of music was when the selection was more  limited. Some djs consistently play crap, of course, but even they are often an improvement from playing the one available cd from El Bandoneón on repeat. The one which skips in the same place every time you play it. And with lower barriers to entry comes increased variety and competition. The dancers could simply move to the next dj that played nice tango music and leave the crap for an empty floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today a beginner dancer or dj can start playing quality tango music from Spotify instantly that would take ages and cost a fortune to collect just 10-15 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when djs that were a bit ahead of the curve think back to the time it felt like an endless walk in the desert trying to get the local tango community up to speed music wise: it turns out it was just the sea pulling back in the instant before the tsunami hit.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Impossibility  of Re-Creating the Tango of Times Gone By</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/oldonliner/179768787/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/67/179768787_c2cf90edc0.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;First Impressionism by OldOnliner, on Flickr&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-nd/2.0/80x15.png&#34; alt=&#34;Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 2.0 Generic License&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/people/oldonliner/&#34;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/people/oldonliner/&#34;&gt;OldOnliner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imagecodr.org/&#34;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a paradox concerning my relationship with tango, and maybe with tango itself. On one hand, I want to learn from the sources, learn the &amp;lsquo;true&amp;rsquo; tango.  If that even exists. On the other hand, I want to see progress, to move on, and to find or invent &amp;lsquo;my own&amp;rsquo; tango. Which may not exist, either. This tension between a certain nostalgia and  the Sisyphean quest for the authentic, and the longing for progress, a rational approach, the tension between being controlled by the tango and taking control over the tango is at once frustrating and tantalizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are, inescapably, products of our time. The way we dress, the way we talk and the way we move has changed in numerous ways over the years, not to mention growing up on a different continent. How the times we live in manifest themselves in people was beautifully captured by this interesting &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/movies/2014/03/why-its-impossible-to-recreate-a-film-shot-by-shot.html&#34;&gt;reflection upon the remake of the classic movie &amp;lsquo;Psycho&amp;rsquo;  in an article in The NewYorker&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The way that people carry themselves—their posture, their gestures, and even the micro-gestures, the sense of sharpness or tremulousness, the brusqueness or smoothness of movements, the pointedness or curves of joints, the decisive rapidity or easy offhandedness with which they move, and the precision or meander of speech—conveys more about their personality and their times than the overt signifiers of fashion or vocabulary.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2009/11/06/tailored-for-tango/‎&#34;&gt;mentioned once before&lt;/a&gt; how I was fascinated by the refined, elegant movements  of&amp;rsquo;El Flaco&amp;rsquo; Dany when he lit a cigarette. This fascination is despite me generally finding the the habit of smoking despicable. Still there was something about about his way, the micro-gestures, the way he carried himself that stays with me. I would never be able to make his way of lighting a cigarette my own, even if I tried. Even if I worked hard, the best I could hope to achieve would be a superficial resemblance, a bleak copy. A fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may learn from the best, the ones that lived during the golden age of tango, or at least from those few who remain.  We may keep trying, but we will never dance their tango. We are left to find our own.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tango (the Dance) Genealogy</title>
      <link>http://simbatango.com/2010/10/08/tango-the-dance-genealogy/</link>

      <guid>http://simbatango.com/2010/10/08/tango-the-dance-genealogy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/styles-evolution.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/styles-evolution.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolution of tango has not followed a single, easy to track, path. It is rather quite a mess, so in an attempt to figure out how it all goes together, I tried putting my current understaning together in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/styles-evolution.pdf&#34;&gt;chart (pdf)&lt;/a&gt; showing the main developments of the tango dance in all its incarnations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to reiterate: in my opinion there are two distinctions that really matter in tango: &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2008/12/03/all-you-need-to-know-about-style/&#34;&gt;Social vs. performance&lt;/a&gt;, which I covered before, and good vs. bad. Which is nothing new, of course:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;No hay tango viejo ni tango nuevo. El tango es uno solo. Tal vez la única diferencia está entre los que lo hacen bien y los que lo hacen mal

There is no old tango nor is there new tango. Tango is one. Perhaps the only difference is between those who do it well and those that do it badly.

&gt; 
&gt; _Aníbal Troilo_
&gt; 
&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the intricacies of &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2010/06/21/on-style/&#34;&gt;style&lt;/a&gt;s and evolution in tango is a fascinating topic, and this is my humble and far from perfect attempt to visualize  tango&amp;rsquo;s development. Constructive criticism, additions and corrections of errors are most welcome. Suggestions for improvements in formatting likewise. Bear in mind that many of the terms are not well defined, and different people may refer to the same things under different names or to different things under the same name&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some notes about this chart: I started out from Stephen Brown&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tejastango.com/evolution.html&#34;&gt;Evolution of Argentine Tango Styles&lt;/a&gt;, but I have made some additions and modifications. The term &amp;ldquo;tango salón&amp;rdquo; is ambiguous at best when describing tango styles. In my opinion, what is often referred to as milonguero style is also tango salón, but there seems to be no widely acknowledged term for social tango not including  milonguero style or nuevo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In lack of a better term, I used &amp;ldquo;Modern Salón&amp;rdquo; to denote the current mix of several styles of social tango. I grouped several geographical styles under the somewhat arbitrary Northern (roughly from Palermo, Crespo  to Pueyrredón, Urquiza and Saavedra etc.), Centre and Southern (roughly La Boca, San Telmo etc). This is in accordance with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.history-of-tango.com/tango-dance.html&#34;&gt;Christine Denniston&amp;rsquo;s observations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created the chart with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.graphviz.org/&#34;&gt;graphviz&lt;/a&gt; (dot), the &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/tango-genealogy.zip&#34;&gt;chart source is available here&lt;/a&gt;. Tango (the Dance) Genealogy by &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2010/10/08/tango-the-dance-genealogy/&#34;&gt;Simba tango&lt;/a&gt; is licensed under a &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/&#34;&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>From &#39;Band Union&#39; to bandoneón?</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/ruedi/1109596068/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1421/1109596068_976729dbd3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;(19.05.07-11.02) - Bandoneon (3) by RÃ¼dis Fotos, on Flickr&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-nd/2.0/80x15.png&#34; alt=&#34;Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 2.0 Generic License&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/people/ruedi/&#34;&gt; Rüdis Fotos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imagecodr.org/&#34;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the origin of the word bandoneón? Two competing theories exist. They both agree that the instrument is somehow named after the assumed inventor, Heinrich Band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name &amp;lsquo;Band Union&amp;rsquo; was used by Heinrich Band and partners, and it got mispronounced and reinterpreted in  Argentina as bandoneón.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name was invented by Band or others based on the naming of other instruments such as the accordion, Band + ion was transformed into bandonion, which in turn became bandoneón in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the discussion following Ms Hedgehog&amp;rsquo;s good &lt;a href=&#34;http://mshedgehog.blogspot.com/2009/07/bandoneon-seen-spelled-pronounced-and.html&#34;&gt;introduction to the bandoneón&lt;/a&gt;, the validity of theory one was questioned, but the German Wikipedia didn&amp;rsquo;t really occur to me as an authoritative source on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, time for a little research. Would it be possible to find early sources referring to this  &amp;rsquo;Band Union&amp;rsquo; or Heinrich Band and the naming of his instrument?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to the last matter, I found this, dating back to 1895:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;**Bando&#39;nion **A kind of Concertina with square ends (keyboards), inv. by  C.F. Uhlig of Chemniz, about 1830, and since then much improved and enlarged. It takes it name from Heinrich Band of Crefeld, a dealer in the instr. --- Comp. art. Harmonicum.

&gt; 
&gt; _[A dictionary of musical terms](http://books.google.com/books?id=7hoQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA23)_ by Theodore Baker 10th edition, 1895
&gt; 
&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An even earlier source of the same is mentioned by Ramon Pelinski in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/780143&#34;&gt;Latin American Music Review / Revista de Música Latinoamericana&lt;/a&gt; that the name of the instrument was &amp;ldquo;Bandonion&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is actually also available online:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Auf veranlassung von Band sowie einiger Spieler wurden nun auch Instrumente mit 88 Tönen gebaut, an denen Band einige Töne unterstimmte und ein Schild mit dem Namen Bandonion anbrachte. Unter diesem Namen wurde das Instrument mehr und mehr bekannt, so dass man jetzt alle Concertinas mit 88 bis 260 Tönen Bandonion nennt.
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; [Zeitschrift für Instrumentenbau](http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/bsb00004237/images/index.html?id=00004237&amp;fip=24.128.198.225&amp;no=1&amp;seite=25) [1890]: pp. 19-21
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As there is some evidence that Band himself named the instrument bandonion, that strenghtens theory 2 considerably. So where did the Band Union theory come from, and why is it so widespread?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A search on books.google.com suggests an answer. It appears this theory is mentioned in several works on the history of tango. Unfortunately, Google books only gives a snippet view of these books, but in some snippets the historian Zucchi is mentioned, and in others the dictionary &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enciclopedia_universal_ilustrada_europeo-americana&#34;&gt;Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeo-americana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zucchi himself &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.todotango.com/english/biblioteca/cronicas/el_bandoneon.asp&#34;&gt;seems to be open for both possibilities&lt;/a&gt;, and cites another scholar, Manuel Román, that found a advertisment by Band from 1850 saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To accordion lovers: about a new invention, once again we have notably improved our accordions, and these newly made, of round or octagonal shape with 88 or 104 tones are available in our shop&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also writes that Román does not believe that Band himself created the bandoneón, rather that it was Carl Zim(m)erman, concluding from said advertisment that Band was neither the inventor of the intstrument, nor the name, although somewhat contradictory he also dismisses the Band Union theory based on there being no records of this company in Krefeld.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alberto Camaño &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.elportaldeltango.com/especial/InfoBandoneon2.htm&#34;&gt;cites another newspaper notice&lt;/a&gt; dates the first mention of the bandonion to 1856 (I don&amp;rsquo;t know the original source of this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Band Accordion Konzertinen”, por algunos llamado “Bandonion&#34;.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This information seems to be confirmed by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.inorg.chem.ethz.ch/tango/band/band_node11.html&#34;&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt;, giving a Joh. Schmitz, Krefeld as the source. If that is correct, it shows that the name was established before the instrument &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.todotango.com/english/biblioteca/cronicas/cronica_bandoneon_2.asp&#34;&gt;arrived in Argentina&lt;/a&gt; some time around 1863-1884.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which leaves us with the Spanish encyclopedia as the primary suspect for the Band Union theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-summarize-the-findings&#34;&gt;To summarize the findings:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bandoneón was based on the concertina, invented by Uhlig of Chemniz around 1830.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concertina was refined into the bandoneón, probably by Zimmermann, not Band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heinrich Band was an instrument trader, and the instrument is named after him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name bandonion was established in Germany, and the name bandoneón is the Spanish version of this, not Band Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;loose-ends&#34;&gt;Loose ends&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some loose ends remain, though, I appreciate help in resolving any of these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have access to _Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeo-americana,__ look up bandoneón and check what it says, and for possible Band Union references._&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have access to e.g &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=L3lQAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;q=%22band+union%22+%22Heinrich+Band%22&amp;amp;dq=%22band+union%22+%22Heinrich+Band%22&amp;amp;lr=&#34;&gt;Acuerdos acercaa del idioma&lt;/a&gt; (1947, p. 144) or Boletín de la &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=P6MwAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;q=&amp;quot;band+union&amp;quot;+&amp;quot;Heinrich+Band&amp;quot;&amp;amp;dq=&amp;quot;band+union&amp;quot;+&amp;quot;Heinrich+Band&amp;quot;&amp;amp;lr=&#34;&gt;Academia Argentina de de Letras&lt;/a&gt; (1978, p. 303) &amp;ndash; search &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;amp;q=&amp;quot;band+union&amp;quot;+&amp;quot;Heinrich+Band&amp;quot;&amp;amp;btnG=Search+Books&#34;&gt;books.google.com&lt;/a&gt; for &amp;ldquo;Heinrich Band&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;bandoneon&amp;rdquo; to find more. &amp;ndash; verify that the Spanish Encyclopedia mentioned above is cited as the source for the Band Union story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Der Bandonionverein Carlsfeld mentions Band Union in their &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bandonion.de/cms/index.php?id=18&#34;&gt;Beginn der Musikinstrumentenproduktion in Carlsfeld&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;Vermutlich hat der Musikalienhändler Heinrich Band aus Krefeld diesen Instrumenten den Namen Bandonion -aus Accord ion = Band Union -gegeben).&amp;rdquo; Which I can&amp;rsquo;t really make much sense of. Anyone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are in NYC, you migh want to check out the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alexmusical.com/accordionmuseum.html&#34;&gt;Accordionmuseum&lt;/a&gt; On their website, they say they have: &amp;ldquo;Band Union: Third model of the first prototype before they were called Bandoneon. Hand made in Germany in the year 1890&amp;rdquo; I was thinking maybe it said Band Union on some early instruments, maybe, but that is mere speculation from my part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check if the source material for the advertisment of 1850 and/or the newspaper notice of 1856 is available in e.g. Zucchi&amp;rsquo;s book (El tango, el bandoneón y sus intérpretes) or in Román&amp;rsquo;s article cited there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
