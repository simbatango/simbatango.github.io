Our eyes connected
Now nothing&#39;s how it used to be
No second guesses

Pull focus close up you and me
Nobody&#39;s leaving

Spun me 180 degrees
It&#39;s so electric

Slow down and dance with me

Skip a beat and move with my body
Yeah...   slow...
Come on and dance with me
Yeah...   slow...
Skip a beat and move with my body
Yeah...   slow...

Don&#39;t wanna rush it
Let the rhythm pull you in
It&#39;s here so touch it

You know what I&#39;m saying
And I haven&#39;t said a thing
Keep the record playing

Slow down and dance with me
Yeah...   slow...
Skip a beat and move with my body
Yeah...   slow...
Come on and dance with me
Yeah...   slow...
Skip a beat and move with my body
Yeah...   slow...

&lt;blockquote&gt;The man who has journeyed all over the world can&#39;t find any novelty in five thousand miles, for he finds only new things -- yet another novelty, the old routine of the forever new -- while his abstract concept of novelty got lost at sea after the second new thing he saw.

&gt; 
&gt; _The Book of Disquiet (171) by Fernando Pessoa_
&gt; 
&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in fashion,  people in dance seem always to be chasing the new black. A performance is no good unless the dancers &lt;em&gt;do something new&lt;/em&gt;. A class is only worth taking if the &lt;em&gt;topic is new&lt;/em&gt;. Dancers are encouraged to find _new steps.. _ and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh well &amp;ndash; nothing is new under the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>12 Tangos -- Adios Buenos Aires</title>
      <link>https://simbatango.github.io/2008/11/19/12-tangos----adios-buenos-aires/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2008 17:06:49 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>simbatango@gmail.com (Simba)</author>
      <guid>https://simbatango.github.io/2008/11/19/12-tangos----adios-buenos-aires/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/12-tangos.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/12-tangos.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The documentary &lt;a href=&#34;http://12tangos.com&#34;&gt;12 tangos&lt;/a&gt; was just released in international version on DVD. It is a documentary, and the Adios Buenos Aires part of the title is somehow more accurate with regards to the content of the film. If you are looking for the Buena Vista Social Club of tango, you will be disappointed. There are no interviews with musicians, and only a few of the oldtimers participate in the orchestra. So Café de los maestros should be a better bet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12 tangos is mainly a film about the hard times in Argentina after the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_economic_crisis_(1999-2002)&#34;&gt;crisis in &lt;sup&gt;2001&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2002&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when many lost everything they had, and quite a lot of people were forced to move to Europe to get work. That is, in the opposite direction of their anscestors, who went from Europe to Argentine for the same purpose. The film tells the stories of a young dancer (Marcela Maiola) going to Paris, her partner, the retired professional dancer (&lt;a href=&#34;http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=ji6R1K_oAUo&#34;&gt;Roberto Tonet&lt;/a&gt;) who is afraid of losing his apartment in order to survive and  a mother (Yolanda Zubieta) leaving her children to go to Spain (she has no apparent connection with tango).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mixed in between these are musical numbers from a concert at La Catedral, a milonga in Buenos Aires. This is where the 12 tangos come in, and they are supposed to work like a framwork for the storytelling, and are marked as chapters on the dvd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it did not take me with storm, I quite enjoyed the film. The photography was excellent at times. I particularly enjoyed the scene that is shown on the cover, where some partly hidden dancers are part of the live show at La Catedral. It works much better in motion than on the cover. The dancing was ok, not stunning, but nice. I did not like the slow motion sequence, though, as the connection with the music is completely lost, but maybe it works better for non-dancers. I admit my preferences in this respect have changed considerably after taking up dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Las muñecas dressed as vampires were hilarious, even if they were even better in _&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0380741/&#34;&gt;Tango, un giro extraño&lt;/a&gt;__. _And Roberto was quite a character :-) But I also found something amiss, like it did not all fit together that well. Maybe the relation between the 12 tangos and the rest of the film was not clear enough.  There were also some peculiarities, like having school-children explain the economic crisis that I found a bit strange. Some glitches in the text, where the English text was suddenly in German.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more about the musicians would have been nice, and the presence of José Libertella was perhaps a bit oversold, as he is only featured in one of the last musical numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall a nice film. And on a completely subjective note, it is so good to see footage from mi Buenos Aires querido, el colectivo, hearing people chit chat, people walking in the streets, the skyline&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the film and the soundtrack are available from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://12tangos.com/&#34;&gt;film&amp;rsquo;s website&lt;/a&gt;. It took about a week from I order until I had the discs in my hand. For immediate listening, I just discovered that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.emusic.com/album/Luis-Borda-12-Tangos-Adios-Buenos-Aires-MP3-Download/11320075.html&#34;&gt;the sountrack is available on emusic&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I started DJing</title>
      <link>https://simbatango.github.io/2008/11/17/how-i-started-djing/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://flickr.com/photos/emotionblog/31746277/sizes/l/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/turntable.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Turntable&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/2.0/80x15.png&#34; alt=&#34;Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 2.0 Generic License&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/people/emotionblog/&#34;&gt; AllegaertMe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imagecodr.org/&#34;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started dancing tango, the &amp;ldquo;milonga&amp;rdquo; was in a café where we basically heard the same double &lt;a href=&#34;http://musicbrainz.org/release/980413af-3c95-445e-9855-0f975c1f0f13.html&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/a&gt; over and over and over. In general, everybody knew exactly what song came next and started humming on the next song before it started. Knowing the music is all good, but,  well&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-I guess I would start djing, was the dry comment from an American dancer we met in Bs As a few years ago when I told this story. Well, as it happens that was exactly what I ended up doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that was a long time ago, up in the ice desert, so not much tango music available, and nobody really seemed to care (about the music), don&amp;rsquo;t ask me why. And nobody knew about tango djs, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some dancers in our community had been to Argentina, but they all moved out of town. And none of the active dancers in our community had been there. So when I went with my partner (later wife), we were kind of breaking new ground. And much so in the case of tango music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many others starting out in tango, I found the typical tango to be dull sounding, and it all sounded much the same to me. So I was searching for new recordings with fresh sound. After searching record stores in my home town, I found little other than Piazzolla, but coming to Zival&amp;rsquo;s in Buenos Aires, the selection was huge. (You will have to remember that this was before the wealth of information available online today, and it was before the crisis in Argentina, so everything there was pretty expensive.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I had no idea what to search for, but I had a list from my teachers in Buenos Aires, with strange names like Troilo, D&amp;rsquo;Arienzo and Pugliese&amp;hellip;  Most cds were short on milongas and valses, so I remember using the number of vals and milonga on a cd as a selection criterion. In retrospect, it all went really well, my next record extravaganza was far from as successful. I also  bought modern orchestras like El Arranque, Color tango and Los cosos de al lao. As s many others, I have grown to prefer the classic recordings, but that&amp;rsquo;s a different story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, and they did not play it like on our cd in the milongas, (3 tangos, 1 milonga, 1 vals, repeat). There was this concept of tandas and cortinas. I found some information on the web, &lt;a href=&#34;http://tejastango.com/tango_music.html&#34;&gt;Stephen Browns pages&lt;/a&gt; were a great help I remember, but the concept was unheard of in my local town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back from Bs As, I started assembling tandas of similar sounding music sitting on our livingroom floor, writing notes, this and that track from this cd, then this and that track from that cd, and then all the cds to the computer in the office to create a cd of precompiled tandas&amp;hellip;  A lot of work, and far too little music to make a good selection. But it was the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few years, and I have a real collection of tango music (You really like D&amp;rsquo;Arienzo, don&amp;rsquo;t you? asked one visiting instructor, borrowing some cds for classes) all neatly tagged on my computer for instant access and on-the-fly tanda composition at the milonga. I did a lot of mistakes on the way, of course, but I have improved vastly. And people are finally starting to pay attention to the music in my local community, and we have a few aspiring djs for whom I gave a seminar on tango djing last year. Now even more are interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/hammer.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/hammer.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Models can be very useful. By making a simplified version of the world that we are able to grasp, we may learn something about the world outside the model as well. This approach has proven very successful in a lot of areas, and is also applied to tango.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a danger associated with model building, as everyone working with them should know, and that is to mistake the model for reality. To forget that you had to do some simplifications to make comprehendable model out of the apparenly chaotic world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also tends to shape the way we think about the world we modeled. Which can be fine, as that is part of the purpose. However, it assumes we got all important aspects covered by the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two sayings that illustrate the danger of using a hammer as your model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your only tool is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;rsquo;t solve it with force, use a larger hammer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-nuevo-theory&#34;&gt;The nuevo theory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tango nuevo methodology, or rather theory, was developed be Naveira and Salas, and is quite influenced by the Dinzels, of which Naveira I think was a student. It is quite interesting, as it breaks everything down to small pieces, and explain very complex sequences as sequences of these basic building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be very useful when you want to explain a sequence, but I always wonder when a teacher says something like &amp;ldquo;There only exist six steps in tango&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; If they really mean it, or just use it as a simplification.  What would be more precise would be something convoluted like &amp;ldquo;According to the Naveira-Salas model (or tango nuevo), all (or rather a large number of) steps can be broken down to six basic movements&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; So I understand why people do not say that teaching. But I am afraid many people actually believe that you can get to the bottom of tango by understanding these principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use it to analyze and describe an astonishingly large number of tango sequences, but you also miss some.  Mistaking the model for reality, you never realize what your model does not cover. When you look the model inventors dancing, and the same with their students, there are some obvious omissions in their vocabulary, which I leave as an exercise for the reader ;-) I don&amp;rsquo;t assume that the guys that figuered out this neat theory to believe it to be a theory of everything, but I am afraid quite a few of their students do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, since this theory is so concerned with breaking up old steps/patterns, and exploring &amp;lsquo;new&amp;rsquo; ones, the users of the theory all seem to be very occupied with &amp;ndash; steps. And there is a lot more to tango than steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem withe the dance created by using this model, is that everything is equally good, it seems. Since it is all about exploring &amp;lsquo;new&amp;rsquo; possibilities, these possibilities should not be ruled out. But in the evolution of the dance, quite a lot of possible steps and sequences have already been tried out and thrown in the garbage, either because was not nice, or if it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel good. Remaining is an enormous set of steps/sequences that allow for a uniquely complex dance. The tango student should learn not only which are the possibilities, but also which work well and which don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up, the nuevo theory can be very helpful in learning sequences, but it is dangerous if you don&amp;rsquo;t know its limitations. As with all powerful tools: handle with care.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just &lt;a href=&#34;http://12tangos.com/&#34;&gt;ordered the new documentary 12 tangos&lt;/a&gt;. Will be very interesting to see, it also claims to be a Buena Vista Tango Club, so a shootout between 12 tangos and Cafe de los maestros. 12 tangos has a great advantage in being actually available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will get back to it later, in the meantime, the trailer:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Old tango hero</title>
      <link>https://simbatango.github.io/2008/10/09/old-tango-hero/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On our first visit to Buenos Aires, we rented a room in San Telmo. Right in the neighborhood is the Centro Cultural Torquato Tasso. For some reason we never came around to go there, even if it was by far the closest milonga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until one evening, we finally found space in our schedule to visit El Tasso. There was to be live music, and we were quite excited. The place was packed with people, and all of a sudden an old man was announced, and with support from a couple of guys he entered the stage. He was obviously going to sing with the orchestra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he started to sing, it was clear to us that he had once had a great voice, but we thought that was long ago. After the first song, however, his voice seemed to be warmed up, and we could hear with our own ears that this had been one of the great heros of tango music. And if we could not hear it, we could see it from the people in the room, cheering him from the back of the venue, singing along with all his famous tunes. (Of which we were shamefully ignorant). On the dance floor, I could hardly move at all. The pista felt so packed that if I would lift my feet, I would be carried with the flow. Quite frustrated, I could see that the more experienced dancers were doing all kind of stuff, giros and everything, all without taking any space. Amazing and very frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody was there, including some very famous dancers, and all the people we saw regularly in the milongas.  So one great experience richer, we wrote about the evening in our travel diary and went on with our schedule. Before returning home, we got some tips from our tango teachers for music to buy at Zival&amp;rsquo;s. The names Di Sarli, Troilo and D&amp;rsquo;Arienzo did not mean much at the time, and I remember being amazed by my teachers&amp;rsquo; spotting of Puglieses &lt;em&gt;Gallo ciego&lt;/em&gt; one evening at the &lt;em&gt;Niño Bien&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some years later, I was listening to a tango cd. And it struck me how similar this was to the old man in El Tasso. Could it be&amp;hellip;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the old travel diary, to check the details. I wondered if it could be &lt;em&gt;Alberto Castillo&lt;/em&gt;, a name I had grown to appreciate over the years. And in the diary it said black on white, that indeed, Alberto Castillo it was. One of the very great, and appreciated enthusiastically, however ignorantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;httpvh://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=sxELJ3Lccx8&amp;amp;NR=1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alberto Castillo died not much after, and I believe this was one of his last performances. which I am greatful to have experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another good documentary about tango. I enjoyed it a lot. Some of the interesting scenes are available on youtube, but the documentary itself was quite hard to get hold of. As far as I could determine, it is not available for sale, not even on ebay, so you better know one of them pirates or use your imagination ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am quite impressed by how ordinary dancers are able to express what tango means to them. I always find it hard to describe what in tango I love so much or why I came to be obsessed with tango.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it made me long for Buenos Aires. A lot. And that hurt. But it was still a good experience, a tango experience I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Classes and entertainment</title>
      <link>https://simbatango.github.io/2008/09/22/classes-and-entertainment/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2008 11:01:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>simbatango@gmail.com (Simba)</author>
      <guid>https://simbatango.github.io/2008/09/22/classes-and-entertainment/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why do people take classes? When I first started out in tango, I assumed people attended to classes to learn how to dance or to improve their dance, learning steps or improving technique or other skills. How naïve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After several years more, I have discovered that people take classes for a variety of reasons, some of which I find perfectly reasonable, others I still cannot really understand. The good reasons are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning tango&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meeting people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The not so good reasons (in my opinion, of course):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As entertainment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To dance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, learning to dance is a no-brainer. Also, I can see that classes are a good way to meet other dancers, especially when you are coming without partner or other friends, or are visiting a new city. (For instance when going to Buenos Aires, taking some classes is a good way of getting started on your entourage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classes as entertainment first came clear to me as a tango organizer and teacher in my home community. We were arranging weekend classes, and suffered from very low retention rates. Struggling with this for years, I suddenly realized that the weekend class market was a different from our main target (the objective being to recruite dancers to our community). People wanted to try something new for the weekend and get entertained. Fair enough, some got the taste of it and came back, most never did. Also many couples came, and they never wanted to change partner. In this context it is understandable, they were taking the class to do something together, not to learn tango. They simply wanted to dance with their partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This I can understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people who are already devoted to tango, travel around the country and around the world to dance, however take classes they have no interest in whatsoever, I am puzzled. Just waiting for the teacher to throw them something new, something exciting every 15 minutes, with no intention on working on doing it right. Being there for the entertainment, and just dancing whatever, taking no notice of the world class teacher&amp;rsquo;s comments. In one particular case the teachers were quite upset, as these people obviously did not understand what they were trying to teach them. (Not steps.) And this frustration I can easily understand from my own teaching experience. I sometimes wish people not giving a damn about what is being taught would just leave and not destroy the learning environment for the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This I cannot understand. If you just want to do your own thing, go to a práctica or a milonga. If you are not interested in learning, let someone else have your place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: If you take classes to meet people, this still holds, you should choose a teacher which teaches something you would like to learn, this greatly increases the chance of you meeting people you will enjoy dancing with.&lt;/p&gt;
