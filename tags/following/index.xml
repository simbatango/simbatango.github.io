Johanna wonders about the negative connotations of &amp;ldquo;following&amp;rdquo;. There is nothing wrong with following, following is crucial to make the dance work, and that is no simple task. The problem is being assigned the role of simply following, being the &amp;ldquo;follow(er)&amp;rdquo;.
Or should I say reduced to follower.
Just as there is nothing wrong with listening, but being assigned the role of being the listener is somehow limiting.</description>

      <description>Johanna&amp;rsquo;s comment and her subsequent post on leads and follows inspired me to write an entire post in addition to the comment in her blog. In her post (and follow-up) she argues why you would want to use the terms lead and follow for the two dancers in a tango embrace, and discuss howthey are surrounded with angst.
I find it to be the terms man and woman that are surrounded by angst, and that is probably the reason people use lead and follow as euphemisms for man and woman.</description>
