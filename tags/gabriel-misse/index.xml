      <description>I meant to post this a while ago, and was reminded when I saw the amazing video from a performance at the Sydney Tango Salon Festival. Coincidentally, I met the organizers in Buenos Aires last year, small world it is :-) But that&amp;rsquo;s not the point, the point is that The New York Times once again publishes an interesting read about Gabriel Missé and Natalia Hills (The first view is for free, then you hit the paywall):</description>

She and he combine gorgeously. No acrobatic lifts (no lifts at all, if I remember rightly), no high kicks; just two bodies scarcely sundered while dancing in unbroken streams of changing ideas to the music.</description>
