      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/music-instinct.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/music-instinct.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know more about music than you think. You start picking up the rules from the day you are born, yes even before. And part of what makes music enjoyable is this knowledge of what to expect and the delight when your expectations are fulfilled, or some times bent a little before they find resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of the message of a fascinating book about music, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Music-Instinct-Works-Cant-without/dp/1847920888/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1271619437&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;The Music Instinct&lt;/a&gt; by Philip Ball, (read reviews for instance in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15450498&#34;&gt;The Economist&lt;/a&gt;, or in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/feb/21/the-music-instinct-philip-ball&#34;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;) a book that I finally had time to finish reading this week-end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philip Ball has reviewed a lot of research on how our brains process music, and combines that knowledge with music theory and research in a very interesting blend. I enjoyed it a lot, and there is clearly material for quite a few posts here, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the time to process it all yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already as small children we have figured out a lot of  the rules of music, but mainly about the music with which we are familiar. Ball investigates what is universal and what is based on cultural habit, how we interpret pitch, scales, melody, harmony,  rhythm, syntactic rules, semantics, the list goes on and on. In the final chapter he among other things discusses whether music can be interpreted incorrectly  &amp;ndash; fascinating topics and very relevant to tango as to all other music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recommended read, and I&amp;rsquo;ll certainly get back to this later. Did you know that even an amoeba can respond to rhythm? Seems unlikely tango beginners could lack that ability&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Experiment shows: walking heel first more efficient</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/heel-first-toe-first-e1266332407571.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/heel-first-toe-first-e1266332407571.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will not, of course, settle the agelong debate of whether to walk toe first or heel first in tango. Still, I found it interesting that there has recently been  published research on the efficiency of the human walk, specifically investigating walking heel first versus walking toe first.  If you are striving for the most efficient walk, their conclusion might be worth noting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; When human subjects walked with their heels slightly elevated in a ‘low-digitigrade’[toe first] posture, COT [cost of transport] increased by 53% above that of normal plantigrade [heel first] walking.
&gt; 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; Cunningham, C. B., Schilling, N., Anders, C. andCarrier, D. R. (2010).
[The influence of foot posture onthe cost of transport in humans](http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/213/5/790?ijkey=ce57e4d265e26213e5a9717dc550495b1e75a6c9).
J. Exp. Biol. 213, 790-797
&gt; 
&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers were wondering why we are not walking and running toe first like many other animals and wanted to test the hypothesis that walking heel first is more efficient. They did experiments with different walks and runs on a treadmill where they could measure the oxygen consumption of their subjects at normal walking speed. They also did experiments with running subjects, where this difference does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the reasons for the increased efficiency of walking heel first are (p. 796):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;lower collisional losses of the body as a whole&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;increased recovery of kinetic and potential energy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;lower ground reaction force moments specifically at the ankle joint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not very surprising, maybe, to anyone who has tried both ways, but now you&amp;rsquo;ve got the reference :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their paper says nothing about style, of course&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Eating the marshmellow</title>

&lt;p&gt;I just read a very interesting article in the New Yorker about research on people&amp;rsquo;s ability to deter satisfaction, and how it could be a character treat determined very early. The researchers performed an experiment where children were given the choice of eating a marshmellow now, or wait fifteen minutes, waiting in front of the marshmellows, and get two marshmellows. Some kids were able to find ways of distracting themselves, earning the extra marshmellow in the end. Others just couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait and had it right there and then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This experiment was performed quite some time ago, and the researchers are now performing new experiments with the same subjects, now grown-ups, and find correlation with their success in life. Career-wise, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all corresponds nicely with microeconomic theory: Delay some consumption and invest, in order to get something more to consume later. The right thing to do. Rational and wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to some of us, waiting was never the problem. The problem is living right here and now. Seizing the day. And some of us learn about that through tango. Tango, or more precisely going to the milongas, is about eating the marshmellow. Savouring the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some times, the right thing is to eat the marshmellow.&lt;/p&gt;
