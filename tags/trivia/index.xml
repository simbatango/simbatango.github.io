      <description>When were the different tangos recorded? From theÂ 9233 unique recordings identified with exact recording date in the tango.info database we can see that not surprisingly there is low activity during summer, more specifically during January and February, it then picks up with peaks in June, September and December. Splitting the numbers over the decades makes a slightly more confusing picture.
If you want to check out the recordings for one specific date, there is now a nifty feature over at tango.</description>
