&lt;p&gt;I just read a very interesting article in the New Yorker about research on people&amp;rsquo;s ability to deter satisfaction, and how it could be a character treat determined very early. The researchers performed an experiment where children were given the choice of eating a marshmellow now, or wait fifteen minutes, waiting in front of the marshmellows, and get two marshmellows. Some kids were able to find ways of distracting themselves, earning the extra marshmellow in the end. Others just couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait and had it right there and then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This experiment was performed quite some time ago, and the researchers are now performing new experiments with the same subjects, now grown-ups, and find correlation with their success in life. Career-wise, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all corresponds nicely with microeconomic theory: Delay some consumption and invest, in order to get something more to consume later. The right thing to do. Rational and wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to some of us, waiting was never the problem. The problem is living right here and now. Seizing the day. And some of us learn about that through tango. Tango, or more precisely going to the milongas, is about eating the marshmellow. Savouring the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some times, the right thing is to eat the marshmellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you probably know, tango is not merely a dance. Among other things, the dance is also a language. It is not like a language, because the different movements have different meanings, which can be used for actual communication. It is not a metaphor. However, when people copy movements without realizing the underlying meaning, &lt;a href=&#34;http://lonewalker.blog.co.uk/2009/01/25/midsummer-nights-tango-part-5441668/&#34;&gt;the result is movements with no meaning&lt;/a&gt;. Empty movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or even worse, you may be saying something without knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is somehow like writing calligraphy for decoration only, selecting the &amp;ldquo;nice letters&amp;rdquo;, not knowing the meaning of what you are writing. How about a tattoo reading &amp;ldquo;A fool and his money are easily parted&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Prostitute&amp;rdquo; in Chinese? Don&amp;rsquo;t laugh, it recently happened that a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/chinese-classical-poem-was-brothel-ad-1058031.html&#34;&gt;science journal used an ad for a brothel to decorate the front page&lt;/a&gt; of a special issue on China. They thought the letters &amp;ldquo;looked nice&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So be careful with your tango, remember its mythical origin&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sabor a tango</title>

&lt;p&gt;It is common to say that we taste four diffent tastes: sweet, salt, bitter and sour. Combinations of these make up all other tastes. Sounds familiar? You may be guessing what I&amp;rsquo;m getting at&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience of taste, or should I say the experience of a meal, which we humans make for the pure pleasure of enjoying the different tastes and combinations, consists of &lt;strong&gt;a lot more&lt;/strong&gt; than these four basic tastes (some also include umami, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the point).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the four basic tastes, the &lt;strong&gt;consistency&lt;/strong&gt; of what we eat obviously makes quite a difference, porridge and beef are quite different in this respect, spaghetti needs to be &lt;em&gt;al dente&lt;/em&gt;. Whether it is hot or cold,  hard or soft, wet or dry&amp;hellip; The list goes on and on. We also have &lt;strong&gt;pain&lt;/strong&gt; receptors in the mouth, which respond to things like chili, adding the spicy sting that the Argentines do not seem to enjoy very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;smell&lt;/strong&gt;s are also very important. This is a point frequently made by the wine connoisseurs, much of what we consider taste, is actually smell, try to enjoy a nice vintage while your nose is blocked by a cold&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presentation&lt;/strong&gt;, or the visual aspect of food also makes quite a difference. No surprise that the finest cuisines make a lot of effort in presenting their food as delicately and elegantly as possible, balancing colour, volumes and textures for the best possible visual experience in addition to the tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the &lt;strong&gt;ambience&lt;/strong&gt; or context of the meal also adds a lot (or reduces, depending on the circumstances). Sitting alone in a nice restaurant does not create the same feelings for the food as sharing it with good friends in a nice environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably guessed already, the same goes for tango. What makes up a good dance, or a good night depends on a lot of factors, and we need to add some spice to the dance to keep it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t dance all porridge, add some spice to your dance. And make sure to savor &lt;strong&gt;everything it has to offer&lt;/strong&gt;. Why not explore some new flavours the next time you go out dancing?&lt;/p&gt;
