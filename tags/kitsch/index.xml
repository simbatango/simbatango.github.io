      <description>There is something about the word tango that seems to have a power in itself. Everybody seems to share the idea that tango is something special. Tango&amp;rsquo;s strong image in the public conscience is not quite the same as we tango addicts have, as we actually know the authentic tango culture and (I suppose) think of it when we hear the word.
To a large degree, the image the general public has of tango is imposed from the depiction of tango in popular culture, and movies in particular.</description>
