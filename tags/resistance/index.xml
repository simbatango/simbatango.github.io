Tangocommuter is constructive and a man of action. Simba likes that. Following up on his own idea to distribute the homage to the milongueros, he has created a flyer, and I am happy to host it here at simbatango.com.
The challenge is, in his own words:
   (...) print out a lot of copies, with an attractive picture, perhaps that of the entrance to Sin Rumbo, so that it looks like a regular leaflet, to leave on the table at the entry of every milonga we go to…    Quietly sneaking in a little education in the milongas.</description>
