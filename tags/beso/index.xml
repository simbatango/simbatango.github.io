      <description>Look what Simba got for Father&amp;rsquo;s Day! Guess which is now the favourite book for the night-time reading? Even beats That&amp;rsquo;s not my Dinosaur. The daddy frog and the froglet seems to be my son&amp;rsquo;s favourite part of this book, though.
The book is by Anne Gutman and Georg Hallensleben, published by chronicle books.</description>

      <description>by Kevin Steele
Buenos Aires is not like home. And when in Rome, drive like the Romans&amp;hellip;
And the Argentines kiss when they meet. Better get used to it.
(...) would lean over, ready to commit the act that, I thought, was reserved only for girlfriends and, on occasion, family. This guy used a few months it seems, but has written a really entertaining account of the argentinian kissing habits.</description>
