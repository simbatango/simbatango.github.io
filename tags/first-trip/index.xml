&lt;p&gt;Privates can be tough. Very useful, but tough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our first trip to Buenos Aires, my wife and I took privates with Julio &amp;amp; Corina, and we worked on the basics. Of course. We learnt a lot, but it was so much to think about. So much we did wrong. So much to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my own sake, it felt like they deconstructed my whole body, just to leave the parts on the floor. For me to pick up and bring back for the next lesson. I felt like I could not dance at all for about a week. (Which was maybe not so far from the truth, as I had not really been dancing for that long.) Even at the prácticas, I felt out of place, unable to relax and enjoy the dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took some time to reassemble, but it was definitely worth the effort. In reaching the next level, one&amp;rsquo;s awareness of the things that need to be fixed, can give some headache, but when you finally get there, it really improves your dancing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general feeling has been repeated with various other teachers over the years, but with more experience it takes less effort to put myself together after groundbraking changes. Well &amp;ndash; maybe not less effort. But it breaks me down for a shorter time. And I am better prepared in advance. Maybe the errors I have to fix are not as grave as they used to be. I like to think of it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3036/2743432350_0c65f60994.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Go before it&#39;s too late&#34; /&gt;When should you go to Buenos Aires?I would say: as soon as possible. Go before it&amp;rsquo;s too late! You will gain nothing by waiting. You will not be good enough, anyway ;-) But do by all means go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wait until you are &lt;em&gt;ready&lt;/em&gt;, you risk missing out on the entire thing. Going to milongas in your neighborhood, you will believe you improve to become a good dancer, and that you know what tango is about. If you do, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; go to Buenos Aires, you will have to take the lesson. You will not be the best dancer by far. You will have to work to get dances. But it will be worth it. If you go earlier, chances are you are more humble, and get more out of the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, to really get the tango, you have to breathe the air of the city, watch the porteños walk by in the streets, hear your neighbours play tango music and discuss music and life with the taxi drivers on your way to the milongas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is based on observations of an extremely small sample of people, but I think i makes sense :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So order these tickets, the sooner the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://alextangofuego.blogspot.com/2008/03/going-to-buenos-aires.html&#34;&gt;a post about the benefits of going over at Alex Fuego&lt;/a&gt; earlier, go there as well..&lt;/p&gt;
