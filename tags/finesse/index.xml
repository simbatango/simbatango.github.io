&lt;p&gt;Breaking the dance of tango down to its smallest parts is a popular exercise. Why stop at forward-side-back-steps? What it really comes down to is one simple concept. If you can do it, you can tango. Or at least you need to be able to do it to dance it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standing on one leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a week-end class, we had one student with some condition that made it impossible for her to stand on one leg. Which was sad because the communication did not work at all. I was sorry to realize that she would never be able to dance tango, even if she really wanted to. We did our best to make it work and for her to have a good time, of course,  but it was quite clear that tango was not for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may seem all too obvious to write a blogpost about, no? Well, there is a more subtle point I wanted to make. The best dancers have a clarity and elegance, simplicity of movement that we all long for (I suppose). And to a large degree it stems from their ability to stand on exactly one leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No less, no more&amp;hellip; ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of lack of finesse&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s with the watching the floor all the time, checking the floor before each step, head moving from side to side, constantly, as if chasing cucarachas. I did not come up with this description myself, but it is very fitting, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoever came up with this new &amp;lsquo;style&amp;rsquo; (or rather lack thereof)? Somebody near them should tell them that it looks ridiculous. And please stop doing it. It is just plain wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staying in Buenos Aires for a few months provided several eye-openers. One of the great revelations was concerning the logic of the dance, or rather the lack of it, and how this adds spice to the dance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were taking lessons with various teachers, with very different philosophies with respect to tango, how to dance it and how to learn it. Gustavo Naveira, the great master, dissected each step carefully, explaining exactly how and why and which steps were crossed and which were open etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming then to another lesson with the quite different teachers, I asked once why I was to go with this foot, and not with the other, as I could not make any sense of this particular combination. Jorge looked at me, as if he did not understand the question. Why? Because the step is like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only later did it make any sense to me. It was actually when los Disparis showed another step. A step where the man deliberately hides which foot he has weight on. To make it less obvious which direction the turn will be.  Going in the not so logical direction. Or perhaps not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding a touch of finesse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember several years earlier, another tango teacher told us that the man should always have a little surprise for the woman, a sorpresita, to make her feel she was something special. And in the same way, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt having a sorpresita for the spectators as well. At least if you are giving a show, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this leads to one reason I find a lot of performances unbearably boring. The dancers do a lot of things, trying to be innovative. But it shows a mile a head where they are going. No sorpresita. Lacking even the slightest hint of finesse.&lt;/p&gt;
