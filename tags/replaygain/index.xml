Music mastered at different levels can be a pain when you&amp;rsquo;re a dj, as well as when listening to music at home. The great differences in loudness levels is in part due to what is sometimes called the &amp;ldquo;Loudness War&amp;rdquo;, but sometimes it is just inconsistent between different issuers. As long as you listen to a CD/compilation as it was designed from the issuer, there is no problem, it is when you start mixing tracks from different sources that the volume starts jumping up and down&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>There was some discussion on the tangodj mailing list about the use of Replay Gain for tango music. I have used it for several years, and found it to be immensely useful. As you can see from the histogram above, the loudness of cd releases varies a lot, and Replay Gain makes automatic adjustments to make the loundess more or less the same. It does a lot better than I do, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure, and frees up time for the more interesting parts of the djing.</description>
