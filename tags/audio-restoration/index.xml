      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/SprBroMorSapICASSP13-figure1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/SprBroMorSapICASSP13-figure1.png&#34; alt=&#34;SprBroMorSapICASSP13-figure&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pondering the usefulness of noise removal based on several copies of a recording, possibly from different physical copies. A Google search reveals that such a technique is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/patents/US5740146&#34;&gt;already patented&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The present invention provides a method for reducing noise using a plurality of recording copies. The present invention produces a master file with lower noise than the available recording copies, and avoids the problems of losing musical content caused by prior art pop and click removers. The system comprises a recording playback unit, a computer system with a sound input capability, and a high capacity storage system such as a CD recorder. In operation, a plurality of recording copies of a single recording are played on the playback unit. These recordings are digitized by the computer and a separate recording file is formed for each copy of the recording. The recording files are then synchronized. The samples from each of the recording files are then averaged to reduce the noise components. A variety of threshold comparison techniques can be employed to eliminate samples and/or recording files that are outside of a computed range for that sample.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing a little more research I found the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~simond/match/index.html&#34;&gt;MATCH&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/doc/tutorial/en/sv-alignment.pdf&#34;&gt;plugin for Sonic Visualiser&lt;/a&gt;, which sort of does what I had in mind, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out how to process the aligned audio to get two aligned files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method is described in a 2005 &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~simond/pub/2005/dafx05.pdf&#34;&gt;paper by Simon Dixon&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dynamic time warping ﬁnds the optimal alignment of two time series, but it is not suitable for on-line applications because it requires complete knowledge of both series before the alignment can be computed. Further, the quadratic time and space requirements are limiting factors even for off-line systems. We present a novel on-line time warping algorithm which has linear time and space costs, and performs incremental alignment of two series as one is received in real time. This algorithm is applied to the alignment of audio signals in order to follow musical performances of arbitrary length. Each frame of audio is represented by a positive spectral difference vector, emphasising note onsets. The system was tested on various test sets, including recordings of 22 pianists playing music by Chopin, where the average alignment error was 59ms (median 20ms). We demonstrate one application of the system: the analysis and visualisation of musical expression in real time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found&lt;a href=&#34;http://vista.eng.tau.ac.il/publications/SprBroMorSapICASSP13.pdf&#34;&gt; another paper by Pablo Sprechmann, Alex Bronstein, Jean-Michel Morel and Guillermo Sapiro&lt;/a&gt; who seem to do exactly what I had in mind. This is fresh stuff, and I found no reference to any available software implementation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A method for removing impulse noise from audio signals by fusing multiple copies of the same recording is introduced in this paper. The proposed algorithm exploits the fact that while in general multiple copies of a given recording are available, all sharing the same master, most degradations in audio signals are record-dependent. Our method ﬁrst seeks for the optimal non-rigid alignment of the signals that is robust to the presence of sparse outliers with arbitrary magnitude. Unlike previous approaches, we simultaneously ﬁnd the optimal alignment of the signals and impulsive degradation. This is obtained via continuous dynamic time warping computed solving an Eikonal equation. We propose to use our approach in the derivative domain, reconstructing the signal by solving an inverse problem that resembles the Poisson image editing technique. The proposed framework is here illustrated and tested in the restoration of old gramophone recordings showing promising results; however, it can be used in other applications where different copies of the signal of interest are available and the degradations are copy-dependent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you happen to be in Vancouver in the end of May, you can attend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.icassp2013.com/Papers/ViewPapers.asp?PaperNum=4586&#34;&gt;their presentation at ICASSP 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m curious as to how much difference this would make in practice compared with traditional statistical approaches. Theoretically, it would be very interesting for getting the most out of tango recordings where the masters are long gone and  would reduce less man hours for manual restoration. However, it would require extra effort as each track would have to be digitized from multiple physical copies, not to mention that you would need access to more than one physical copy of each recording. Something to think of for a project like&lt;a href=&#34;http://tangovia.org/&#34;&gt; TangoVia&lt;/a&gt;, that multiple copies of the same material might actually be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Too Fast Transfers</title>
      <link>https://simbatango.github.io/2011/06/15/too-fast-transfers/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/raza-criolla.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/raza-criolla.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sort of promised to post a few samples of my results from slowing down some tracks that &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2011/05/07/dym-online-tango-classics/&#34;&gt;I believe are transferred at too high speed in the DyM Tango Classics collection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I have suspected that several other transfers, most notably on the El Bandoneon label were transferred at too high speed, I never tried slowing them down myself because I knew it to be hard to find the correct speed. Maybe impossible. To know you got the right signal (as in as similar or undistorted relative to how it sounded before it entered the recording chain), you would have to know the tone played at some time during the recording, and how the instrument that played that tone was tuned. Even though there are scores for many tangos, the exact arrangements are rarely available, and even then you would have to know that the musicians did not deviate from what was written there (e.g. transposing up or down a (semi)tone). And how the instrument was tuned. Most commonly the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_pitch&#34;&gt;concert pitch&lt;/a&gt; A is supposed to be 440 Hz, but it has varied from time to time and from orchestra to orchestra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not trivial in other words as I basically had access to exactly none of the required information. I usually tried to get another and hopefully more correct transfer, leaving the problem to be sorted out by someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now with some of these De Caro recordings, it was just too annoying, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t know of any other transfers available (which was why I got them in the first place). So I gave it a try. As I don&amp;rsquo;t have perfect pitch and didn&amp;rsquo;t have the above mentioned information, I did it by trial and error, and I paid particular attention to the timbre of the piano, attack, decay etc and generally tried to assess whether it sounded &amp;lsquo;right&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be interested to hear your opinion, here are two examples, both by Julio De Caro, El taita/Raza criolla and Maipo. First original as transferred by DyM, then my 7 percent slowed down versions (about one semitone). EDIT: I added some samples for tracks that I believe are not so readily available: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tango.info/04024236200191-1-7&#34;&gt;Berretín&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tango.info/04024236200498-1-4&#34;&gt;Lorenzo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tango Audio Restoration</title>
      <link>https://simbatango.github.io/2010/03/01/tango-audio-restoration/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screenshot.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Screenshot.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tango music was recorded with equipment much inferior to what is available today. Adding to that, the record companies threw away the master&amp;rsquo;s leaving us with reproductions based on the shellac records that further deteriate the sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many of the commercial releases of tango music, the Reliquias series, the 78RPM series etc, the transfers have been cleaned and the noises removed for the music to become more clear and easy to listen to. And believe me, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t listened to a shellac record from the 1920s, you probably have no idea how much noise and hiss there can be on those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, in some cases the audio engineer cleaning the sound gets too excited about his capabilities and applies too much filtering, effectively throwing out some of the music along with the noises he is trying to remove. Because once the signal (the music) is mixed with the noise, there is no way to reliably separate the two completely again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industry state of the art has been the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cedaraudio.com/intro/declick_intro.html&#34;&gt;Cedar&lt;/a&gt; noise removal systems, which are very expensive, professional equipment. Enter the revolution of digital sound and digital signal processing (DSP).  Now the same tasks can be performed with much cheaper equipment, often with better results. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adobe.com/products/audition/&#34;&gt;Adobe Audition&lt;/a&gt; is an example of a product that gives you a lot of possibilities in this area, much cheaper, but still rather pricey for an amateur that wants to clean up some old tango recordings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, the great thing about the CTA series of Mr. Akihito Baba is that they are close to raw transfers from the shellac records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;**P &amp; M: **You can clean some noises during the process of recording CDs these days.

**Baba: **Yes , but on the other hand I don&#39;t want to cut the noise when I reproduce SPs. I like to reproduce SPs without cutting down hig waves to reduce the noises. You can use an equaliser to cut the noises down well, but I decided not to do so. There are others who make clean sound reproductions in Japan. But there are good SP´s not containing any so-called noises, so you don&#39;t have to cut any noises. When you cut the noises, quite often it loses the other sounds as well at the same time. That&#39;s a shame as well.

&gt; 
&gt; From [interview with Mr. Akihito Baba](http://pythia.uoregon.edu/~llynch/Tango-L/2001/msg00791.html)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about that is that you can take the old records of Mr. Baba and apply today&amp;rsquo;s computer tools that use sophisticated algorithms to clean up the sound, often with very impressive results. I wanted to check the capabilities of the free software tools &lt;a href=&#34;http://audacity.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;Audacity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://gwc.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;Gnome Wave Cleaner&lt;/a&gt;. While researching them, I saw references in various forums to a shareware software called &lt;a href=&#34;http://clickrepair.net/&#34;&gt;Click Repair&lt;/a&gt;. It can be tried for free for 21 days, and the results are quite encouraging, even with the default settings, both for Click Repair, and DeNoise by the same author. That they produce good results with little manual intervention is important, as manual audio restoration is a very time consuming process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer a little noise to over processed sound, but I also prefer no noise to the noise of the old 78 rpms. In the continuum between these extremes, I think the sweet spot for me is more like 80%-90% clean, limiting the probability of audible distortion to the signal of interest, i.e. the music. And I have hope it can be achieved by batch processing the cta discs and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing I like almost more than the impressive results, is that the software lends itself to automation. There are some adjustments that would ideally be made for each track, and I will make those for each cd instead, and reprocess single files if they turn out problematic. From my experiments so far, the noise profiles of records seem fairly similar, and the amount of noise more or less the same on records from the same years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check that you are not removing any important information, you can easily switch between three listening modes, the input signal (unprocessed music), the output signal (the processed music) and the difference (the noise that is removed). By checking the noise, you can be fairly sure you&amp;rsquo;re not removing any actual musical content by applying too aggressive processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to get better results by doing it manually, but I have no time for  redrawing waveforms manually on hundreds or thousands of tracks. Well, not until when I retire ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few samples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first one is a nice orchestra with recordings from the 1940s with clicks and pops that were annoying me. The software doesn&amp;rsquo;t output the noise, but I made a simulation (taking the difference between the original and the processed) to give you an idea of how it sounds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Manuel-Buzon-Al-verla-pasar-original.mp3&#34;&gt;Manuel Buzon - Al verla pasar - original&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Manuel-Buzon-Al-verla-pasar-processed.mp3&#34;&gt;Manuel Buzon - Al verla pasar - processed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Manuel-Buzon-Al-verla-pasar-noise.mp3&#34;&gt;Manuel Buzon - Al verla pasar - noise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then some material from the 1920s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Juan-MaglioPacho-Alma-tanguera-original.mp3&#34;&gt;Juan Maglio(Pacho) - Alma tanguera - original&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Juan-MaglioPacho-Alma-tanguera-processed.mp3&#34;&gt;Juan Maglio(Pacho) - Alma tanguera - processed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a nice D&amp;rsquo;Arienzo from the 1930s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Juan-DArienzo-La-bruja-original.mp3&#34;&gt;Juan D&amp;rsquo;Arienzo - La bruja - original&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Juan-DArienzo-La-bruja-processed.mp3&#34;&gt;Juan D&amp;rsquo;Arienzo - La bruja - processed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these are (to my knowledge) unavailable in pre cleaned versions, so a little restoration will be worthwhile. The next question is: Can the results be even better than some of the commercially processed releases? We&amp;rsquo;ll get back to that in an upcoming post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some readers reported difficulties with playing the mp3 files from the web player, you can download &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/short-mp3.zip&#34;&gt;all the samples in one zip file &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
