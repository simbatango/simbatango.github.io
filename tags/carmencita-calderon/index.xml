&lt;p&gt;I have seen quite a few dismissive comments of a certain embrace lately, someone calling it &amp;lsquo;Reaching for the man&amp;rsquo;s back pants pocket&amp;rsquo;-embrace just recently (&lt;a href=&#34;http://tangocherie.blogspot.com/2009/08/tango-salon-winners-in-mundial-2009.html&#34;&gt;in the comments, here&lt;/a&gt;). Which doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound very nice to me. I assume it is the one pictured above that is referred to, although I would have to say she is a little off if she is going for this pockets. I suspect the misunderstanding concerning the pockets comes from seeing this as a intention downwards embrace, while it is quite the oposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, people may embrace as they please, but this crititcism seems a little narrow-minded to me. I, on the other hand get an urge to dance every time I see someone embracing this way because, when done correctly, it feels very good and improves the connection with my partner, who can participate actively with her left hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone dismissed it as a fad. That may well be, but it sure is a long lived one. If you see the famous film snip of Carmencita Calderón dancing with the legendary El Cachafaz, you see her using a variation of this embrace. (As opposed to having her arm around his neck). That footage is from the 1930s. So I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t put much money on it going out of fashion anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
