      <description>**Jim used to wonder** why he never enjoyed dancing---why he hesitated whenever he asked a friend to be his partner. One evening when he was trying to make up his mind to ask a very charming young lady to dance, he suddenly realized that if his dancing were more modern... he would get more enjoyment out of life. Jim took a few lessons at the Arthur Murray Studios. Today he is not only an excellent dancer, but he has also gained poise and confidence.</description>
