Time to upgrade my deejaying slogan. While I still sort of like the tongue in cheek fluffy deejay advertisment in-joke of **Keine komische Musik, **it has several problems. It is in German, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really translate well. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure people get the joke, they may not even understand German. Also it may come off a bit negative. I would prefer a more positive note, so to speak.</description>

Who hasn&amp;rsquo;t been tempted&amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip; to do some flashy moves when someone sitting next to the dance floor watches.
&amp;hellip; to show all the tricks of the trade when getting to dance with a really good dancer
&amp;hellip; to play some obscure gem from the record collection when djing
&amp;hellip; to play some music to be innovative
The problem is, it does not impress anyone.</description>

When I started dancing tango, the &amp;ldquo;milonga&amp;rdquo; was in a café where we basically heard the same double cd over and over and over. In general, everybody knew exactly what song came next and started humming on the next song before it started. Knowing the music is all good, but, well&amp;hellip;
-I guess I would start djing, was the dry comment from an American dancer we met in Bs As a few years ago when I told this story.</description>
