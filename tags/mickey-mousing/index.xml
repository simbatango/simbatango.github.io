      <description>It seems to be spreading, a new way of interpreting music in tango. Every so often I hear people rave about some couple&amp;rsquo;s outstanding musicality and more often than not it translates to their mimicking every little plink and plonk in the music with a corresponding movement. Naturally, it requires good knowledge of the song to do this, but does it really demonstrate such great musicality?
I once heard this way of dancing calledÂ Mickey Mousing, as it was like this music was often used in animations, many from the 1930s and the 1940s.</description>
