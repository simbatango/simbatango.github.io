&lt;p&gt;If you prefer your naïve, pure emotional interpretation of the tango, you might not want to read this. If, on the other hand you think that knowing a little about how tango music is organized might increase the breadth or depth of your musical appreciation, then this could be for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&#34;http://tangocommuter1.blogspot.com/2009/08/three-minute-question.html&#34;&gt;Tangocommuter writes&lt;/a&gt; in the discussion of how a tango became approximately three minutes long, a prototypical tango has the structure ABA:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Most tangos, and most songs generally, are A-B-A in structure. It&#39;s a structure people seem to like, it works well musically and in a song. 16-bar blues follow much the same pattern. In practice, we get three segments of around 16 bars each. 16 bars to a minute, mas o menos, 48 bars start to finish. 48 bars of four beats each, that&#39;s 192 beats in three minutes, which is... 64 beats a minute. A familiar number. 192 heart beats to a tango.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best example to look for in my knowledge is the orchestra of Carlos Di Sarli, which adhered fairly strictly to a regular scheme for all his tangos.  A musician I met in Buenos Aires told me that Di Sarli was known as the master of something I think he called the quadratic form or something similar. The 16 bars (or measures as they are often called) can again be divided into four phrases of 4 bars of two strong and two weak beats each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what is more interesting than this little arithmetic is that these 4 sections of 4 bars form a structure of theme and variations inside the main structure of the tango. Gustavo Naveira called this &amp;lsquo;call&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;response&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;question&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;answer&amp;rsquo;, I don&amp;rsquo;t recall exactly. My musician friend objected to this and called them variations.  Whatever you want to call it, it is there, and you can hear it and use it in your dancing if you like. With the second being a response to the first and the fourth being a response to the third, there is also some sort of nested structure of dialogue between the first two phrases and the two last. Very neat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, creating a choreography is an art in itself, and sadly there are very few that master this art &amp;lsquo;a full&amp;rsquo;, as they would say in Buenos Aires. Taking this structural knowledge into the choreography would be a good framework to build a choreography around, one would imagine. In my own attempts to do semi choreography dances, matching the main turning points of the music was always a major concern, and that is why I find it so surprising (and disappointing) that so many performances seem to pay no attention at all to the general structure of the song they are performing to. Not even the main structure of main theme (A or AA), the contrasting theme (B) and the final variation (A again). I mean, not even reflecting the development from beginning to end. Just unmotivated throwing out of crowd pleasing steps in all directions from the start. I don&amp;rsquo;t get it. It is soooo boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this seems to be a disease which is prominent with the followers of the maestro that first taught me about this in a dance context. I find it somewhat ironic that the dancers most concerned with the &amp;lsquo;structure of tango&amp;rsquo; (the dance) seem to overlook completely the structure of tango (the music). Maybe it will come later in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2009/01/16/reinvention/&#34;&gt;reinvention&lt;/a&gt; project?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we are not doing choreography, you may protest. True, but still you have to listen to the music, and knowing just a little about what to listen for, might improve your listening (and thus dancing) experience. One gringo that was also taking the same seminar with Naveira found that part of the class utterly uninteresting  &amp;ndash; clearly you can already hear this, he said. Which is sort of true for many dancers, on the other hand, watching many people dance, one has to wonder&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I do not suggest that you start counting over and over again while you are out at the milongas dancing with your friends and strangers in the night, far from it. However, it can be useful to listen carefully for the specific developments of the music during one tango and try dancing to it. It should come as no surprise that a large number of step combinations taught are actually matching exactly one phrase in tango (8 strong beats or four measures/bars). Try it with the normal basic step if you still remember it&amp;hellip; Also it can be useful to try combining walking exercises (which you still do regularly, no?) with phrasing exercises. For example doing one kind of adornos for one full phrase. No less and no longer. Exactly one phrase. I suggest you try with Di Sarli, pick any song basically, as he conforms fairly closely to this scheme. We have good experience with walking our student through these exercises, even without much explanation, as moving with the phrases gives an intuitive understanding of the music, which you will eventually bring to the dance floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jorge Dispari talked about how people &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2009/05/10/on-circulation/&#34;&gt;used to interpret the music in a more similar fashion&lt;/a&gt; in the golden age of tango, I suspect this might be part of what he was talking about (the A(A)BA structure). I everyone is saving their giros and extra stuff for the final variation, then everybody stops progressing at the same time, and nobody gets hurt.. Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to take his music seminar, so this remains my theory or speculations if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, comments and corrections from more knowledgeable readers are most welcome&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ready for a new year of tango? Remember that if you want to improve, there is &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2008/11/11/the-secret-dont-tell-anyone/&#34;&gt;no secret&lt;/a&gt;, all you have to do is to follow three simple steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn from the best&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practice (&lt;a href=&#34;http://tango.yyquest.net/learning-process/2009/10000-hour-rule/&#34;&gt;a lot&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen to lots of music&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody ever said it was gonna be easy ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why we never tire of tango music</title>

&lt;p&gt;Tango music for the non-argentine 21st century tango lover is often something of an acquired taste. At least for tango dancers. The recordings are old, the music sounds strange, we don&amp;rsquo;t understand the lyrics &amp;ndash; but we love the dance&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some time, we get more into the music, it all changes, and we become total fanáticos de tango, we can never get enough of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://tejastango.com/classic_tangos.html&#34;&gt;classics of tango music&lt;/a&gt;. Why do we never get tired of listening to these old recordings, often transferred from old, scratchy 78s, since &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.totango.net/rca.html&#34;&gt;the masters were burnt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will often hear tango lovers rave about the &lt;em&gt;complexity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;richness&lt;/em&gt; of tango music. So let us investigate a bit further what is the source of this richness. The title of the first record by the orchestra Escuela de tango, &lt;em&gt;De contrapunto&lt;/em&gt; gives us the first clue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to categorize music is by the musical textures, and the three main categories are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monopohonic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homophonic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polyphonic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophony&#34;&gt;Monophonic&lt;/a&gt; music consists of a single melody line, and is the simplest form of musical texture. Perhaps the best known example in western music is the Gregorian chant. The monophonic music is also the easiest to understand or interpret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophony&#34;&gt;Homophonic&lt;/a&gt; music is slightly more complex, as it consists of a principal melody line accompanied by a chordal accompaniment. Perhaps a bit surprisingly, it is the most recent &amp;ldquo;invention&amp;rdquo;, as it basically did not occur in music created earlier than the end of the 16th century. It was used in a lot of romantic music for increased clarity and thus emotional impact, in contrast with the most complex form, polyphony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony&#34;&gt;Polyphonic&lt;/a&gt; music is the kind that is the most demanding of the listener. Several melodic lines, or &amp;ldquo;voices&amp;rdquo;, are present at the same time, forming harmonies as they go. To appreciate this, you may have to disregard some parts of the music, and the melodic line (horizontal) will become apparent. This gives a different listening experience than &amp;ldquo;just listening&amp;rdquo; to all the sounds present at the same time (vertical). Depending on which lines you choose, the same piece may be experienced somewhat differently each time. And this is what is actually meant when dancers talk about dancing to different instruments. All voices need not be present at the same time, of course, and some melodic lines will move from instrument to instrument, so dancing different voices would be a more precise definition of what you are actually doing. (The clue from de contrapunto is that &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint&#34;&gt;counterpoint&lt;/a&gt; is one special case of polyphonic music)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote Aaron Copland in the book &lt;em&gt;What to listen for in music&lt;/em&gt; (on which this post leans heavily),  &amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;repeated hearings keep up your interest better than music of homophonic texture. Even supposing that you do not hear all the separate voices equally well, there is every likelihood that when you return to it again, there will be something different for you to listen to. You can always hear it from a different angle.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pop music springs out from the homophonic tradition from the romantic music. While being popular music, tango from the golden age has a certain quality that you will not generally find in today&amp;rsquo;s popular music, the polyphony. And that also explains why it is much less interesting to dance to pop music than the real stuff. It is simply not enough to throw in some bandoneón samples or having more or less the right rhythm. More on that in a later post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The polyphonic nature of most tango music means there are a lot of ways to listen to the same tune, you can discover something new time after time. And it makes the music sound fresh every time. And thus the dance stays fresh as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Classes and entertainment</title>
      <link>https://simbatango.github.io/2008/09/22/classes-and-entertainment/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2008 11:01:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>simbatango@gmail.com (Simba)</author>
      <guid>https://simbatango.github.io/2008/09/22/classes-and-entertainment/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why do people take classes? When I first started out in tango, I assumed people attended to classes to learn how to dance or to improve their dance, learning steps or improving technique or other skills. How naïve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After several years more, I have discovered that people take classes for a variety of reasons, some of which I find perfectly reasonable, others I still cannot really understand. The good reasons are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning tango&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meeting people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The not so good reasons (in my opinion, of course):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As entertainment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To dance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, learning to dance is a no-brainer. Also, I can see that classes are a good way to meet other dancers, especially when you are coming without partner or other friends, or are visiting a new city. (For instance when going to Buenos Aires, taking some classes is a good way of getting started on your entourage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classes as entertainment first came clear to me as a tango organizer and teacher in my home community. We were arranging weekend classes, and suffered from very low retention rates. Struggling with this for years, I suddenly realized that the weekend class market was a different from our main target (the objective being to recruite dancers to our community). People wanted to try something new for the weekend and get entertained. Fair enough, some got the taste of it and came back, most never did. Also many couples came, and they never wanted to change partner. In this context it is understandable, they were taking the class to do something together, not to learn tango. They simply wanted to dance with their partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This I can understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people who are already devoted to tango, travel around the country and around the world to dance, however take classes they have no interest in whatsoever, I am puzzled. Just waiting for the teacher to throw them something new, something exciting every 15 minutes, with no intention on working on doing it right. Being there for the entertainment, and just dancing whatever, taking no notice of the world class teacher&amp;rsquo;s comments. In one particular case the teachers were quite upset, as these people obviously did not understand what they were trying to teach them. (Not steps.) And this frustration I can easily understand from my own teaching experience. I sometimes wish people not giving a damn about what is being taught would just leave and not destroy the learning environment for the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This I cannot understand. If you just want to do your own thing, go to a práctica or a milonga. If you are not interested in learning, let someone else have your place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: If you take classes to meet people, this still holds, you should choose a teacher which teaches something you would like to learn, this greatly increases the chance of you meeting people you will enjoy dancing with.&lt;/p&gt;
