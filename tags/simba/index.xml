      <title>Moving</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a short meta update. The time for moving has come, both physically and technologywise. In a few months I will be moving back to my hometown, which happens to have a vibrant tango community. Looking forward to that. I do have some ideas for posts, but what little time I have for tango at the moment is spent actually dancing and djing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, this blog has moved, for a variety of reasons. There were some layout problems that I never found the time to fix. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t have as much time for writing about tango, but still wanted to keep the site up, I was looking for a simpler and cheaper way of hosting. And finally, besides articulating my thoughts through writing, this is also a playground for me to try out new web technology. So I moved to static html pages, automatically generated that is. Which is both moving forward in using popular new technologies, and a return to the basics, as that was how I used to make webpages back in the days, before starting this blog. So fitting in many ways I think. Hope you like the new &amp;ldquo;responsive&amp;rdquo; layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to make sure most pages kept the same urls or have redirects, let me know if anything is broken, and I will try to fix it as soon as I get around to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments are moved to Disqus, and they seem to have carried over ok. I haven&amp;rsquo;t finally decided whether to keep them though, as the social aspect of blogging seems to largely having been taken over by the so called social media. I do want to keep the old comments, though. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how it works out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DÃ­a del padre/Father&#39;s Day</title>

&lt;p&gt;Look what Simba got for Father&amp;rsquo;s Day! Guess which is now the favourite book for the night-time reading? Even beats &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Thats-Dinosaur-Touchy-Feely-Board-Books/dp/0746048149&#34;&gt;That&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Thats-Dinosaur-Touchy-Feely-Board-Books/dp/0746048149&#34;&gt;&amp;rsquo;s not my Dinosaur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The daddy frog and the froglet seems to be my son&amp;rsquo;s favourite part of this book, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is by Anne Gutman and Georg Hallensleben, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chroniclebooks.com/index/main,book-info/store,BOOKS/products_id,3306/&#34;&gt;published by chronicle books&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
