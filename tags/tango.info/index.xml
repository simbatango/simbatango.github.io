I had a couple of requests for the plugins for MusicBrainz Picard in the last months. I haven&amp;rsquo;t used them much myself, as there sadly are few contributers on tango music to the MusicBrainz metadata database.
However, I just checked whether they worked with the current format of tracks.csv from tango.info and the newest release of Picard (0.12.1). With one minor adjustment, they now do, and I uploaded the new versions to be found on thetagging with MusicBrainz Picard page.</description>

      <description>Golden Age of Tango When was the Golden Age of tango, exactly? It is fairly common to say 1935-1955 mas o menos, but while I was playing around with the data at tango.info, I thought it would be fun to make a plot to **see when the Golden Age was. And here it is. **
These are the number of unique recordings in the database, so if a recording is issued on several cds, it is only counted once.</description>
