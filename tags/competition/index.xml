People often think of ballroom dancing when they hear I dance tango. Assuming I participate in competitions. And we would not want anybody to think that, would we?
It appears absurd to me, but it occurred to me the other day that they assume dancing is about sports. Which it is obviously not. It is all about culture.</description>

For some reason, people often assume I dance competitions when they hear I&amp;rsquo;m a tango dancer. Not so, I tell them. The only competition is to get to dance with the best dancers.
And while I still believe that to be true to some extent, a friend (who is an excellent dancer himself), put me on a better track. Why is it so important to dance with the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo;, he asked.</description>
