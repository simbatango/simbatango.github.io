 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I heard about the Dinzel book, I thought it was sort of a curious project. Working through all possibilities of tango steps, charting them out in elaborate diagrams with circles and arrows in all directions demonstrating the vast space of choreographic possibilites. I had a look at the book at a friend&amp;rsquo;s place several years ago, but it felt somehow disconnected to how I experienced the dance. This was rather early in my days of tango though, so maybe I would get more out of it at a later point. (If anyone of you got the book, I would love to have a picture/scan for illustration purposes of this post.) [EDIT: You can see an &lt;a href=&#34;http://shytanguero.blogspot.com/2009/10/once-upon-time.html&#34;&gt;example of one diagram here&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to Chris for providing another diagram, shown below (click on the image to see the full resolution version):]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://img534.imageshack.us/img534/2171/dinzelpasobasetangoavan.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://img534.imageshack.us/img534/2171/dinzelpasobasetangoavan.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never took lessons with the Dinzel myself, but I heard from friends that they would often do exercises to explore the different possibilities from a given position, sort of like a game. Only after a friend that was going to Gustavo Naveira&amp;rsquo;s classes with us told us she started taking lessons with his old maestro, did I make the connection. In fact Gustavo also states in  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.danceoftheheart.com/naveirainterview.htm&#34;&gt;an interview&lt;/a&gt; by Brian Dunn that he was a student of the Dinzel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]hen I was in my twenties, about 1981, I started studying with Rodolfo Dinzel. I was one of his best students within that course, and he took special notice of me and worked me very very hard.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is actually a rather interesting interview, so I encourage you to read it all. It also motivates the search for a new approach to learning tango:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; You know, in my study of tango, often I would encounter a &#34;tango master&#34;, and even if you approached them respectfully, they would have an attitude of, &#34;I know everything, you are sh**, don&#39;t bother me&#34;. This is a typical attitude from an earlier way of looking at tango. So it was often very difficult to learn useful things about tango from them.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fabián Salas elaborates on this in &lt;a href=&#34;http://totango.net/salas2.html&#34;&gt;another interesting interview&lt;/a&gt; by Keith Elshaw:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; At one point, I remember that we were very concerned about all these dancers dying - all these milongueros, all these teachers, they were dying. One after the other, three or four in one year. It was catastrophic. So I said, &#34;Gustavo, we are on our own; there is hardly anybody any more and if there is, we can&#39;t do much about it because it&#39;s hard to talk to these people. We have to start learning from ourselves. We have to start bringing the process along and the only way to do it is getting together. Why don&#39;t we join with the people that we consider are good dancers that have something to offer with this idea of, you know, changing - exchanging things? Getting together and practice in a serious way. Analyze.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe anybody who has been in the tango world for a while can agree that there are some great egos out there, so this is easy to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems clear to me that Gustavo inherited the analytical approach of the Dinzel and took it to another level with his collaboration with Fabián Salas and Mariano &amp;ldquo;Chicho&amp;rdquo; Frumboli. And watching this clip of the Dinzel couple, I think I can recognize some of the ways or habits of Gustavo Naveira, for instance the way he is turning his foot when he is waiting with no weight on it, where most (?) other dancers use a flat foot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: Unfortunately, youtube has just disabled the sound on this video, making it a lot less interesting to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you prefer your naïve, pure emotional interpretation of the tango, you might not want to read this. If, on the other hand you think that knowing a little about how tango music is organized might increase the breadth or depth of your musical appreciation, then this could be for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&#34;http://tangocommuter1.blogspot.com/2009/08/three-minute-question.html&#34;&gt;Tangocommuter writes&lt;/a&gt; in the discussion of how a tango became approximately three minutes long, a prototypical tango has the structure ABA:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Most tangos, and most songs generally, are A-B-A in structure. It&#39;s a structure people seem to like, it works well musically and in a song. 16-bar blues follow much the same pattern. In practice, we get three segments of around 16 bars each. 16 bars to a minute, mas o menos, 48 bars start to finish. 48 bars of four beats each, that&#39;s 192 beats in three minutes, which is... 64 beats a minute. A familiar number. 192 heart beats to a tango.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best example to look for in my knowledge is the orchestra of Carlos Di Sarli, which adhered fairly strictly to a regular scheme for all his tangos.  A musician I met in Buenos Aires told me that Di Sarli was known as the master of something I think he called the quadratic form or something similar. The 16 bars (or measures as they are often called) can again be divided into four phrases of 4 bars of two strong and two weak beats each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what is more interesting than this little arithmetic is that these 4 sections of 4 bars form a structure of theme and variations inside the main structure of the tango. Gustavo Naveira called this &amp;lsquo;call&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;response&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;question&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;answer&amp;rsquo;, I don&amp;rsquo;t recall exactly. My musician friend objected to this and called them variations.  Whatever you want to call it, it is there, and you can hear it and use it in your dancing if you like. With the second being a response to the first and the fourth being a response to the third, there is also some sort of nested structure of dialogue between the first two phrases and the two last. Very neat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, creating a choreography is an art in itself, and sadly there are very few that master this art &amp;lsquo;a full&amp;rsquo;, as they would say in Buenos Aires. Taking this structural knowledge into the choreography would be a good framework to build a choreography around, one would imagine. In my own attempts to do semi choreography dances, matching the main turning points of the music was always a major concern, and that is why I find it so surprising (and disappointing) that so many performances seem to pay no attention at all to the general structure of the song they are performing to. Not even the main structure of main theme (A or AA), the contrasting theme (B) and the final variation (A again). I mean, not even reflecting the development from beginning to end. Just unmotivated throwing out of crowd pleasing steps in all directions from the start. I don&amp;rsquo;t get it. It is soooo boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this seems to be a disease which is prominent with the followers of the maestro that first taught me about this in a dance context. I find it somewhat ironic that the dancers most concerned with the &amp;lsquo;structure of tango&amp;rsquo; (the dance) seem to overlook completely the structure of tango (the music). Maybe it will come later in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2009/01/16/reinvention/&#34;&gt;reinvention&lt;/a&gt; project?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we are not doing choreography, you may protest. True, but still you have to listen to the music, and knowing just a little about what to listen for, might improve your listening (and thus dancing) experience. One gringo that was also taking the same seminar with Naveira found that part of the class utterly uninteresting  &amp;ndash; clearly you can already hear this, he said. Which is sort of true for many dancers, on the other hand, watching many people dance, one has to wonder&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I do not suggest that you start counting over and over again while you are out at the milongas dancing with your friends and strangers in the night, far from it. However, it can be useful to listen carefully for the specific developments of the music during one tango and try dancing to it. It should come as no surprise that a large number of step combinations taught are actually matching exactly one phrase in tango (8 strong beats or four measures/bars). Try it with the normal basic step if you still remember it&amp;hellip; Also it can be useful to try combining walking exercises (which you still do regularly, no?) with phrasing exercises. For example doing one kind of adornos for one full phrase. No less and no longer. Exactly one phrase. I suggest you try with Di Sarli, pick any song basically, as he conforms fairly closely to this scheme. We have good experience with walking our student through these exercises, even without much explanation, as moving with the phrases gives an intuitive understanding of the music, which you will eventually bring to the dance floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jorge Dispari talked about how people &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2009/05/10/on-circulation/&#34;&gt;used to interpret the music in a more similar fashion&lt;/a&gt; in the golden age of tango, I suspect this might be part of what he was talking about (the A(A)BA structure). I everyone is saving their giros and extra stuff for the final variation, then everybody stops progressing at the same time, and nobody gets hurt.. Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to take his music seminar, so this remains my theory or speculations if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, comments and corrections from more knowledgeable readers are most welcome&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pas de finesse...</title>

&lt;p&gt;Staying in Buenos Aires for a few months provided several eye-openers. One of the great revelations was concerning the logic of the dance, or rather the lack of it, and how this adds spice to the dance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were taking lessons with various teachers, with very different philosophies with respect to tango, how to dance it and how to learn it. Gustavo Naveira, the great master, dissected each step carefully, explaining exactly how and why and which steps were crossed and which were open etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming then to another lesson with the quite different teachers, I asked once why I was to go with this foot, and not with the other, as I could not make any sense of this particular combination. Jorge looked at me, as if he did not understand the question. Why? Because the step is like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only later did it make any sense to me. It was actually when los Disparis showed another step. A step where the man deliberately hides which foot he has weight on. To make it less obvious which direction the turn will be.  Going in the not so logical direction. Or perhaps not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding a touch of finesse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember several years earlier, another tango teacher told us that the man should always have a little surprise for the woman, a sorpresita, to make her feel she was something special. And in the same way, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt having a sorpresita for the spectators as well. At least if you are giving a show, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this leads to one reason I find a lot of performances unbearably boring. The dancers do a lot of things, trying to be innovative. But it shows a mile a head where they are going. No sorpresita. Lacking even the slightest hint of finesse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/hammer.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/hammer.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Models can be very useful. By making a simplified version of the world that we are able to grasp, we may learn something about the world outside the model as well. This approach has proven very successful in a lot of areas, and is also applied to tango.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a danger associated with model building, as everyone working with them should know, and that is to mistake the model for reality. To forget that you had to do some simplifications to make comprehendable model out of the apparenly chaotic world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also tends to shape the way we think about the world we modeled. Which can be fine, as that is part of the purpose. However, it assumes we got all important aspects covered by the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two sayings that illustrate the danger of using a hammer as your model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your only tool is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;rsquo;t solve it with force, use a larger hammer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-nuevo-theory&#34;&gt;The nuevo theory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tango nuevo methodology, or rather theory, was developed be Naveira and Salas, and is quite influenced by the Dinzels, of which Naveira I think was a student. It is quite interesting, as it breaks everything down to small pieces, and explain very complex sequences as sequences of these basic building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be very useful when you want to explain a sequence, but I always wonder when a teacher says something like &amp;ldquo;There only exist six steps in tango&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; If they really mean it, or just use it as a simplification.  What would be more precise would be something convoluted like &amp;ldquo;According to the Naveira-Salas model (or tango nuevo), all (or rather a large number of) steps can be broken down to six basic movements&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; So I understand why people do not say that teaching. But I am afraid many people actually believe that you can get to the bottom of tango by understanding these principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use it to analyze and describe an astonishingly large number of tango sequences, but you also miss some.  Mistaking the model for reality, you never realize what your model does not cover. When you look the model inventors dancing, and the same with their students, there are some obvious omissions in their vocabulary, which I leave as an exercise for the reader ;-) I don&amp;rsquo;t assume that the guys that figuered out this neat theory to believe it to be a theory of everything, but I am afraid quite a few of their students do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, since this theory is so concerned with breaking up old steps/patterns, and exploring &amp;lsquo;new&amp;rsquo; ones, the users of the theory all seem to be very occupied with &amp;ndash; steps. And there is a lot more to tango than steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem withe the dance created by using this model, is that everything is equally good, it seems. Since it is all about exploring &amp;lsquo;new&amp;rsquo; possibilities, these possibilities should not be ruled out. But in the evolution of the dance, quite a lot of possible steps and sequences have already been tried out and thrown in the garbage, either because was not nice, or if it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel good. Remaining is an enormous set of steps/sequences that allow for a uniquely complex dance. The tango student should learn not only which are the possibilities, but also which work well and which don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up, the nuevo theory can be very helpful in learning sequences, but it is dangerous if you don&amp;rsquo;t know its limitations. As with all powerful tools: handle with care.&lt;/p&gt;
