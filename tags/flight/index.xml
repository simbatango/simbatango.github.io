      <description>Eye contact. According to American Airlines. Funny coincidence I saw this ad just a couple of days before we left for Buenos Aires, as we were flying AA. The photo is taken in San Telmo if I am not mistaken.
Does this mean AA know the cabeceo?
They canceled our flight, by the way, and the car seat did not fit in the seat, and they put us in the very back, so I can&amp;rsquo;t say we were very happy with them, hence no temptation to think it was destiny or anything&amp;hellip;</description>
