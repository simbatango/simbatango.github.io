      <title>Baroque Zamba</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/romero-cover-detail.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/romero-cover-detail.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Going to Argentina for the tango, you end up falling in love with other things Argentine as well. One of these things is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamba&#34;&gt;Zamba&lt;/a&gt;, not to be confused with its Brazilian &lt;del&gt;homonym&lt;/del&gt; homophone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine the surprised look on Simba&amp;rsquo;s face listening to a radio show reviewing some new &amp;lsquo;classical&amp;rsquo; releases. Suddenly they play an  Argentine Zamba, or at least something very similar. The cd in question was the new release from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.clematis-ensemble.be/en/records.php?ID_cat=112&#34;&gt;Clematis Ensemble&lt;/a&gt; with music by composer &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mateo_Romero_(composer)&#34;&gt;Mateo Romero&lt;/a&gt;. It was actually announced as an Argentine Zamba, which I found hard to believe as I thought that was a much later music form, but that was what they said. Anyway, it was beautiful music, all of it, and fortunately already &lt;a href=&#34;http://open.spotify.com/album/6AEgnmfHfTsdsJWiJDK7ez&#34;&gt;available at Spotify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wondered if the Zamba actually came from the Native Americans, but a little wikipedia research and getting my hands on the leaflet cleared the apparent contradiction. As I originally thought the Zamba is much more recent, but the recording was based on what is supposedly the earliest transcribed piece with the rhythm that is used in Zamba. They probably play it a lot more like the contemporary Zamba tradition, though. Nevertheless, beautiful music, great musicality and highly recommended. If you like early baroque music, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tango music for the non-argentine 21st century tango lover is often something of an acquired taste. At least for tango dancers. The recordings are old, the music sounds strange, we don&amp;rsquo;t understand the lyrics &amp;ndash; but we love the dance&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some time, we get more into the music, it all changes, and we become total fanáticos de tango, we can never get enough of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://tejastango.com/classic_tangos.html&#34;&gt;classics of tango music&lt;/a&gt;. Why do we never get tired of listening to these old recordings, often transferred from old, scratchy 78s, since &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.totango.net/rca.html&#34;&gt;the masters were burnt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will often hear tango lovers rave about the &lt;em&gt;complexity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;richness&lt;/em&gt; of tango music. So let us investigate a bit further what is the source of this richness. The title of the first record by the orchestra Escuela de tango, &lt;em&gt;De contrapunto&lt;/em&gt; gives us the first clue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to categorize music is by the musical textures, and the three main categories are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monopohonic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homophonic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polyphonic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophony&#34;&gt;Monophonic&lt;/a&gt; music consists of a single melody line, and is the simplest form of musical texture. Perhaps the best known example in western music is the Gregorian chant. The monophonic music is also the easiest to understand or interpret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophony&#34;&gt;Homophonic&lt;/a&gt; music is slightly more complex, as it consists of a principal melody line accompanied by a chordal accompaniment. Perhaps a bit surprisingly, it is the most recent &amp;ldquo;invention&amp;rdquo;, as it basically did not occur in music created earlier than the end of the 16th century. It was used in a lot of romantic music for increased clarity and thus emotional impact, in contrast with the most complex form, polyphony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony&#34;&gt;Polyphonic&lt;/a&gt; music is the kind that is the most demanding of the listener. Several melodic lines, or &amp;ldquo;voices&amp;rdquo;, are present at the same time, forming harmonies as they go. To appreciate this, you may have to disregard some parts of the music, and the melodic line (horizontal) will become apparent. This gives a different listening experience than &amp;ldquo;just listening&amp;rdquo; to all the sounds present at the same time (vertical). Depending on which lines you choose, the same piece may be experienced somewhat differently each time. And this is what is actually meant when dancers talk about dancing to different instruments. All voices need not be present at the same time, of course, and some melodic lines will move from instrument to instrument, so dancing different voices would be a more precise definition of what you are actually doing. (The clue from de contrapunto is that &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint&#34;&gt;counterpoint&lt;/a&gt; is one special case of polyphonic music)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quote Aaron Copland in the book &lt;em&gt;What to listen for in music&lt;/em&gt; (on which this post leans heavily),  &amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;repeated hearings keep up your interest better than music of homophonic texture. Even supposing that you do not hear all the separate voices equally well, there is every likelihood that when you return to it again, there will be something different for you to listen to. You can always hear it from a different angle.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pop music springs out from the homophonic tradition from the romantic music. While being popular music, tango from the golden age has a certain quality that you will not generally find in today&amp;rsquo;s popular music, the polyphony. And that also explains why it is much less interesting to dance to pop music than the real stuff. It is simply not enough to throw in some bandoneón samples or having more or less the right rhythm. More on that in a later post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The polyphonic nature of most tango music means there are a lot of ways to listen to the same tune, you can discover something new time after time. And it makes the music sound fresh every time. And thus the dance stays fresh as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I started DJing</title>
      <link>http://simbatango.com/2008/11/17/how-i-started-djing/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://flickr.com/photos/emotionblog/31746277/sizes/l/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/turntable.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Turntable&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/2.0/80x15.png&#34; alt=&#34;Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 2.0 Generic License&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/people/emotionblog/&#34;&gt; AllegaertMe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imagecodr.org/&#34;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started dancing tango, the &amp;ldquo;milonga&amp;rdquo; was in a café where we basically heard the same double &lt;a href=&#34;http://musicbrainz.org/release/980413af-3c95-445e-9855-0f975c1f0f13.html&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/a&gt; over and over and over. In general, everybody knew exactly what song came next and started humming on the next song before it started. Knowing the music is all good, but,  well&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-I guess I would start djing, was the dry comment from an American dancer we met in Bs As a few years ago when I told this story. Well, as it happens that was exactly what I ended up doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that was a long time ago, up in the ice desert, so not much tango music available, and nobody really seemed to care (about the music), don&amp;rsquo;t ask me why. And nobody knew about tango djs, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some dancers in our community had been to Argentina, but they all moved out of town. And none of the active dancers in our community had been there. So when I went with my partner (later wife), we were kind of breaking new ground. And much so in the case of tango music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many others starting out in tango, I found the typical tango to be dull sounding, and it all sounded much the same to me. So I was searching for new recordings with fresh sound. After searching record stores in my home town, I found little other than Piazzolla, but coming to Zival&amp;rsquo;s in Buenos Aires, the selection was huge. (You will have to remember that this was before the wealth of information available online today, and it was before the crisis in Argentina, so everything there was pretty expensive.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I had no idea what to search for, but I had a list from my teachers in Buenos Aires, with strange names like Troilo, D&amp;rsquo;Arienzo and Pugliese&amp;hellip;  Most cds were short on milongas and valses, so I remember using the number of vals and milonga on a cd as a selection criterion. In retrospect, it all went really well, my next record extravaganza was far from as successful. I also  bought modern orchestras like El Arranque, Color tango and Los cosos de al lao. As s many others, I have grown to prefer the classic recordings, but that&amp;rsquo;s a different story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, and they did not play it like on our cd in the milongas, (3 tangos, 1 milonga, 1 vals, repeat). There was this concept of tandas and cortinas. I found some information on the web, &lt;a href=&#34;http://tejastango.com/tango_music.html&#34;&gt;Stephen Browns pages&lt;/a&gt; were a great help I remember, but the concept was unheard of in my local town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back from Bs As, I started assembling tandas of similar sounding music sitting on our livingroom floor, writing notes, this and that track from this cd, then this and that track from that cd, and then all the cds to the computer in the office to create a cd of precompiled tandas&amp;hellip;  A lot of work, and far too little music to make a good selection. But it was the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few years, and I have a real collection of tango music (You really like D&amp;rsquo;Arienzo, don&amp;rsquo;t you? asked one visiting instructor, borrowing some cds for classes) all neatly tagged on my computer for instant access and on-the-fly tanda composition at the milonga. I did a lot of mistakes on the way, of course, but I have improved vastly. And people are finally starting to pay attention to the music in my local community, and we have a few aspiring djs for whom I gave a seminar on tango djing last year. Now even more are interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
