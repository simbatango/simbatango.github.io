      <description>Maybe you remember my Letras de Tango post a while back, showing the most used words in tango lyrics. The possibility of doing something similar for other genres/pop music was raised in the comments. And the guys over at last.fm just did exactly that. So head over and have a look at their graphics for Blues, Country, Electronic, Folk, Goth, Hip-Hop, Indie, Metal, Rap, Rock and Soul. They also did some interesting distance charts, showing graphically how similar the lyrics of different genres are.</description>

Last.fm are finally cleaning up their metadata, or at least they have started. If you are on last.fm, why don&amp;rsquo;t you help out by voting for Rodolpho Biagi to redirect to Rodolfo Biagi? (follow the link to faulty spelling, vote at the bottom right). And while you are at it, if you are also a tango dj, why don&amp;rsquo;t join the group tangodj?
Information on tango music has gotten better lately, and a sample from top Pugliese tracks seems reasonable:</description>
