&lt;p&gt;I was dancing a nice tanda with a friend of a friend, and while it was not exactly my favorite music, we were doing fine. We were having a good time. There were lots of people dancing, nobody got hurt, and we were dancing peacefully among the other couples. So far so good&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciated the festival organizers&amp;rsquo; effort to give some extra credit to the djs. I belive they wanted to send a message. But as much as I love that the art of djing is seen as more important than it used to on the northern hemisphere, there is a flip side to it.  They had hired one of the most famous djs in Europe at the time, probably the most famous. He should know what he was doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it happened. I sensed something was wrong. This was several years back, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t instantly recognize it, but there was something strange with the music. It didn&amp;rsquo;t inspire. It didn&amp;rsquo;t fit in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t tango.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dj was being clever. He had played a tango which has some kind of train imitating sounds, much like you find in some blues tunes. Funny. Why not match it with another song with similar sound?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it is a foxtrot, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello!? We are dancing tango, and you throw in a foxtrot? W.. T.. F..?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dutifully finishing the tanda, I went for the exit. Completely threw me off the flow. On the way out, I saw the dj waving to the crowd, the crowd returned the gesture, doing the wave in return. I shivered, and went alone out in the rain, leaving my last festival behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just heard this story, and found it hilarious, about a dancer complaining to the dj. The conversation went something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;-Ur music sux, man!

-Allriiiight... which song would you like me to play?

-!

-Just name one song you would like me to play...

-!!

-Sooo... you don&#39;t actually know any songs, do you...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say; before complaing, you ought to know what you are talking about.. This is valid the other way around also, naturally. There was a discussion on the tangodj mailing list about most weird request. Quite funny reading. And also quite revealing. Maybe (we) djs don&amp;rsquo;t really know everything always&amp;hellip; This conversation possibly went something like this (dramatized by yours truly):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;-Hey, I just love La Tupungatina, can you play it, pleeeease!

-Uh, Tunga Pinta? (...) (mumbling... wtf?)

-Yeah, you know, with Pugliese..?

-Uuuhhm, I don&#39;t have it with ANY orchestra... (mumbling again... Hellooo?)

-Nevermind&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was warned once in a milonga in Central Europe: We have to dance **now, **this is milonga, he won&amp;rsquo;t play much of it. Later there will only be _komische Musik _(comical music).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the best excuse I have ever heard for asking someone (me) to dance! And she was right. The dj had no clue whatsoever and played a lot of &amp;ndash; well, komische Musik. Including cha cha cha, don&amp;rsquo;t ask me what I was supposed to do when that suddenly came on.  The dancers were good though, which was why I came, I met them the night before.  So I made the best out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And adopted it as my slogan as a dj. Keine komische Musik.&lt;/p&gt;
