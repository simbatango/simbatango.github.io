I was dancing a nice tanda with a friend of a friend, and while it was not exactly my favorite music, we were doing fine. We were having a good time. There were lots of people dancing, nobody got hurt, and we were dancing peacefully among the other couples. So far so good&amp;hellip;
I appreciated the festival organizers&amp;rsquo; effort to give some extra credit to the djs.</description>

I just heard this story, and found it hilarious, about a dancer complaining to the dj. The conversation went something like this:
-Ur music sux, man! -Allriiiight... which song would you like me to play? -! -Just name one song you would like me to play... -!! -Sooo... you don&#39;t actually know any songs, do you... Needless to say; before complaing, you ought to know what you are talking about.</description>

I was warned once in a milonga in Central Europe: We have to dance **now, **this is milonga, he won&amp;rsquo;t play much of it. Later there will only be _komische Musik _(comical music).
This is the best excuse I have ever heard for asking someone (me) to dance! And she was right. The dj had no clue whatsoever and played a lot of &amp;ndash; well, komische Musik.</description>
