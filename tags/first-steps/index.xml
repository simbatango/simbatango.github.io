&lt;p&gt;After spending a lot of time relearning how to walk, and teaching others to do the same, it is refreshing to watch a (very) young man learning to walk, in fact learning basically everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following him from being unable to hold his own head, through rolling around and sitting up, getting up by means of whatever furniture or grown up legs are in his proximity is fascinating. It is such a cliché, but watching my son learning all these things is watching a miracle unfold. Un milagro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the the time he will be the age most children learn to walk, we are planning to go to Buenos Aires, and we were kind of hoping he would take his first steps there. Which would be really poetic for a tango dancer, no? However, by his enthusiasm of practicing walking and standing up for short moments unsupported, he might just beat the scheme, like his mother did before him. Time will tell. And my back will hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officially, he will take his first steps there anyways, of course ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
