How could Simba not like a workshop that started by working with bringing out your inner lion? Not the little cute one, but the grown up, strong one?
The day started rather low, though. &amp;ndash;I am not feeling well, and I had been looking forward to this for so long. La princesa went straight back to bed and needed to stay there, it seemed. I was taking our little guy to his arts class, and she would go to the women&amp;rsquo;s technique class with Graciela.</description>

      <description>I was considering using a grandiose title for this post. Something like Return of a King or The Comeback or something along those lines. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite feel that way. I feels more like finally getting a kick in the butt, and slowly getting out of the quagmire, one millimeter at the time.
Actually it was rather two kicks in the butt. The first was that a couple we know here that is in the same situation as us actually went to a tango dance before us.</description>
