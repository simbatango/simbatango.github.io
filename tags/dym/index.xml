      <description>Danza y Movimiento have released anotherbatch of De Caro collections. In addition to the places they were available the last time, they are also available on Spotify (links below).
I haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to listen carefully yet, but the few I have listened to seem to be transferred at the correct speed (unlike some of the older ones).
Just in time for the upcoming día del tango. Enjoy:

I decided to check out the offerings of DyM a bit more closely after I noticed that some of them were available in lossless format from the French site Qobuz. I got a couple of De Caro compilations because they are hard to get by other places. These tracks are mostly from the late 20s and early 30s, so what I found out may or may not apply to other, later recordings issued in this series.</description>

      <description>I just learnt that the German label Danza y Movimiento (DyM) are issuing a new series called Tango Classics. It is based on the collection of the collector Klaus Johns. There seems to be quite a few tracks not available elsewhere, for instance by Julio De Caro, so it should be worth checking out for all you serious collectors out there :-) Also listed at tango.info.
Unfortunately, they only offer mp3 downloads at the time, flac or some other lossless option would be very nice.</description>
