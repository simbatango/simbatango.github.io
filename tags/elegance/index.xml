Breaking the dance of tango down to its smallest parts is a popular exercise. Why stop at forward-side-back-steps? What it really comes down to is one simple concept. If you can do it, you can tango. Or at least you need to be able to do it to dance it.
Standing on one leg.
For a week-end class, we had one student with some condition that made it impossible for her to stand on one leg.</description>

Elegance. You know it when you see it, but it can be hard to point your finger at exactly what it is that makes a couple elegant.
Effortlessness. Natural movement. Simple, clean and concise. No wasted energy.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t come easy.</description>

      <description>To quote Mies van der Rohe, less is more. As in architecture, this is very true in tango, I think. I was always accused of being subtle in my dancing (I always suspected it to be a euphemism for unclear, vague or not present). To my great surprise, after many years learning to dance the milonga - yes learning the milonga, more on this later - one of the things I really had to work on being more subtle.</description>
