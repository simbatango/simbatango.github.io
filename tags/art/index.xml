Several places in Buenos Aires, you will find paintings covering an entire wall, called &amp;lsquo;murales&amp;rsquo;. They have a long history in Buenos Aires, the oldest were painted for the churches of the city in the 1700s and 1800s. In the beginning of the 20th century, they were often used to portray fight against oppression, think Picasso&amp;rsquo;s Guernica. Less political, but as Buenos Aires is the home of tango, there are of course several paintings featuring tango music and dance.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s the year of Darwin this year. In a radio show, different scientists were discussing Darwin&amp;rsquo;s impact on their fields. The art historian made a point out of the fact that after Darwin, people no longer expected the evolution to be linear, or directed towards a specific goal. Always improving. It became clear that modern art would change, take different forms. The direction of change would be an other matter entirely.</description>
