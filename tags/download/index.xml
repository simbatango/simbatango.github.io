Just as I was seriously considering quitting eMusic for good &amp;ndash; they deleted my plan, essentially making it more expensive, after I forgot using my credits in time, they just added a load of tango albums, making it somewhat tempting to stay a while longer anyways. Several of the &amp;lsquo;Grandes del Tango&amp;rsquo; albums published by Lantower were recently added and also some others. They also changed it so you can buy an entire album for 12 credits, which works out well for tango albums often with 20+ songs.</description>
