What is the origin of the word bandoneón? Two competing theories exist. They both agree that the instrument is somehow named after the assumed inventor, Heinrich Band.
 The name &amp;lsquo;Band Union&amp;rsquo; was used by Heinrich Band and partners, and it got mispronounced and reinterpreted in Argentina as bandoneón.
 The name was invented by Band or others based on the naming of other instruments such as the accordion, Band + ion was transformed into bandonion, which in turn became bandoneón in Argentina.</description>
