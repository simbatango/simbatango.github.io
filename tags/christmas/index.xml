      <description>Did you check your list twice? This is old, but I saved it for Christmas time. Not really related to tango, except we were introduced to it by tango people. In spring. My wife&amp;rsquo;s pregnancy was just becoming official, and the unborn baby instantly earned his first nickname: Jorgito. &amp;ndash;But don&amp;rsquo;t name him Jorgito, that&amp;rsquo;s not nice.</description>

      <description>Some friends (also tango maniacs, of course) made this just before Christmas a couple of years ago. A really tasty milonga it was! Welcome to Club Grizelle!

Maybe they can be useful for invitations to your Christmas milonga?</description>
