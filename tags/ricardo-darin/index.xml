      <description>&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;alignnone&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;460&amp;rdquo; caption=&amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;Castillo&amp;rdquo; singing at club &amp;ldquo;Luna de Avellaneda&amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;]&lt;img src=&#34;http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2007/03/07/LunaDeAvellaneda460.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Castillo singing at club Luna de Avellaneda&#34; /&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2009/04/19/tango-film-club/&#34;&gt;tango films&lt;/a&gt;, there are several films where tango is not a main theme, but with some interesting tango scenes. The film &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0347449/&#34;&gt;Luna de Avellaneda&lt;/a&gt; is quite nice, and stands out in that respect. For tango lovers, the opening scene is not to be missed, as it reconstructs the grand party of a community milonga in the golden age of tango. With music, dancing and &amp;ndash; well it looks like one h*** of a party!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2008/10/09/old-tango-hero/&#34;&gt;Alberto Castillo&lt;/a&gt; is singing at the club the night the main character of the movie is born, and the place of the dance hall reminded me a lot of Sunderland in Villa Urquiza. I often wonder what it was like, going out dancing in Buenos Aires in the 40s, and this scene attempts to show us how it was. With a little extra drama thrown in for effect of course..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main theme of the film is how the community and its members struggle during the economic crisis after &lt;sup&gt;2001&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2002&lt;/sub&gt;, somehow using the club as a metaphor for the Argentinian community at large. The film may add some perspective both to the economic conditions in Argentina, and to the perpetual struggle to build and maintain a community in spite of forces working against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I enjoyed the rest of the film as well, the opening scene is what I will always remember. It is brilliant. The great singers and orchestras were clearly stars, and here it really shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The enjoyment of the rest of the film was reduced on my part because I didn&amp;rsquo;t pay attention when I ordered the dvd, and got one without subtitles, and the subtitles I was able to find on the web were not synchronized. But that was all my fault, not a fault of the film itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is amusing to see how many of the argentine films I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that star &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0201857/&#34;&gt;Ricardo Dar√≠n&lt;/a&gt;. He is a good actor, and must be all over the place. If you would like to watch some other Argentine films (not related to tango), I can wholeheartedly recommend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247586/&#34;&gt;Nueve reinas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420509/&#34;&gt;El aura&lt;/a&gt;. Luna de Avellaneda is part of a trilogy, and I will try to find an opportunity to see the other two at some point as well, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0292542/&#34;&gt;Hijo de la novia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0210843/&#34;&gt;El mismo amor, la misma lluvia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
