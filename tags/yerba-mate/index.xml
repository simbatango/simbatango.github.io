A box of goodies was waiting for me when I got back from work this afternoon: Cruz de Malta, Rosamonte mate&amp;hellip;. and Salamandra Dulce de Leche..
I ended up buying from mate-tee.de, it just took a few days, and the price all included was somewhere around 1o-12 dollars a kg. Which is a lot more reasonable than going on buying the world&amp;rsquo;s most expensive yerba.</description>

We always bringyerba mate back from Buenos Aires. It has become another habit as a biproduct of the passion for tango. Everywhere you will see porteños with their little thermoses and the cup with a metal straw, the bombilla, sipping away. In the queue, in the park, on the bus, in tango classes etc etc.
Anyway &amp;mdash; we ran out of the stuff after a couple of months after our return, and went to the specialist tea and coffee store in town.</description>
