&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/eb3rA-2Rlf8&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Clearly, they got something out of all these body mechanics workshops&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is something about the fluffy prose of the tango advertising that is either funny or tragic. Maybe both. Why is it that the ones teaching &amp;lsquo;quality of movement&amp;rsquo; have nothing of the sort? What exactly is &amp;lsquo;organic tango&amp;rsquo;? (&lt;a href=&#34;http://tangovoice.wordpress.com/2010/07/18/organic-tango/&#34;&gt;Tango Voice does a great job in dissecting that term&lt;/a&gt;). What about &amp;lsquo;body mechanics&amp;rsquo;? Apparently these are often &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.no/search?q=&#39;body+mechanics&#39;+&#39;organic+tango&#39;&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;gs_rfai=&#34;&gt;used together&lt;/a&gt;. Now which one is it, organic or mechanic? I am confused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably just me, but my interest in taking workshops seems to be inversely related to the content of this kind of nonsense in advertising. Give me tango pure and simple, and give us teachers that dance well. Thank you for your patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a common misunderstanding that you are not supposed to use your arms when dancing tango.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is wrong on so many levels. I can see where it comes from, as it is a common mistake among beginners to do try leading with their hands, and not using the rest of their bodies. But one thing is to make point to beginners and quite another to elevate it to a universal truth. Yes, it is possible to lead and follow without using your arms and hands. So what? It is possible to lead and follow with no physical contact, too. It just isn&amp;rsquo;t what I would think of as tango.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2009/07/15/homenaje-a-los-milongueros/&#34;&gt;homenaje a los milongueros&lt;/a&gt;? &amp;ldquo;The milongueros are soft and precise in their lead, using their &lt;strong&gt;entire body&lt;/strong&gt; to lead&amp;rdquo; Last time I checked, both arms and hands were part of the body, at least it is still true for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, you know what the spanish word for embrace is? Abrazo.  Ever thought about what &lt;strong&gt;brazo&lt;/strong&gt; means? ( It means arm.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How less becomes more</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/hooverine/2802881741/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3199/2802881741_b187d6c530.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;less is more by hooverine, on Flickr&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/2.0/80x15.png&#34; alt=&#34;Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic License&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/people/hooverine/&#34;&gt; hooverine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imagecodr.org/&#34;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was something she said that stayed with me. So well put. &amp;lsquo;When he leads a step, say backwards for the woman&amp;rsquo;, Graciela said, &amp;lsquo;then there is one possibility: going backwards. There are not three possible steps. Not three, not two. &lt;strong&gt;One.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the time I see so called &amp;lsquo;advanced&amp;rsquo; dancers, throwing their partners around, the women looking like nervous chicken trying to guess the right thing to do for each and every step. It looks like they are thinking: Did he mean here, or here, or maybe here&amp;hellip; .Waiting till the last possible moment before moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then they teach &amp;lsquo;active following&amp;rsquo;, taking the opportunity to teach women to take over control, thereby totally missing the point. It is like deciding which step next is more important than anything else, so we have to make sure we decide 50% each, and to make sure we pass control back and forth all through the tango. Yeah, that sounds nice. My turn! Your turn! My turn!&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the lead is absolutely crystal clear and make﻿s the woman 100% confident she knows exactly what step is led, she will feel like she has all the time in the world to shape the way she makes that step, thus enabling her to express the music. This is what giving the woman space is about, not sending control back and forth. It is a simplification, but we often say that in tango, the man decides &amp;lsquo;what&amp;rsquo;, the woman &amp;lsquo;how&amp;rsquo;. And you have probably heard that in tango, the &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; is more important than the &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt;, no?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the man is actually listening (figuratively speaking) to the woman throughout the dance, he will feel her suggestions and ideas, maybe even before she knows it herself and vice versa. That is when the magic occurs. Passing a stick back and forth is not very magical. Well, maybe if it were a wand&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, I am afraid you have to dance with some really, really good dancers to understand what I mean. Then you may feel how by taking away, you add something. Remove some possibilities and open up for others. Remove the noise and free the signal. Removing all unnecessary cruft from one&amp;rsquo;s dancing is one of the things that make tango a life long project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the magic that arises makes it totally worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is this new milonga in the the town I grew up, and of all things they have called it &lt;em&gt;La colgada&lt;/em&gt;. Now, that gives me all the wrong associations when it comes to a milonga, but from how I know the tango scene there, I guess it is merely truth in advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But come on, naming a milonga after a step/figure? Why on earth would you do that? I guess they think it sounds cool, but it sends out a signal that it is all about the step. And if you read anything I wrote before, you know I don&amp;rsquo;t subscribe to that view at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More reasonable things to use for names of a milonga would be music, selecting a song title or part of a phrase, something based on the location, or maybe the organizer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you want to signal an ambiance of warmth and inclusion, call it &lt;em&gt;El abrazo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a discussion on the tango dj mailing list a while ago about people wanting &amp;ldquo;stuff without the stuff&amp;rdquo;. In other words, tango (dance) without tango (music). An oxymoron, one would think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Brown put it so well with his little story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; A number of years ago, I was in a coffee shop that offered coffee prepared many different ways. One of the ways was decaffeinated coffee with artificial sweetener and artificial cream. They called the result &#34;Why Bother?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Marathon</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/cdm/366676021/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/155/366676021_ca96e56faa.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;marathon sacrifice by darkmatter, on Flickr&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;s with this &lt;em&gt;marathon&lt;/em&gt; thing that seems to be spreading across Europe? I never found anything positive about marathons, running and sweating for hours on asphalt with no break and being totally destroyed afterwards?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, people may dance as they like. Myself, I prefer a nice milonga, champagne at the table, nice and clean clothes, nice and calm. Having a ball. Walking.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Top 40</title>
      <link>https://simbatango.github.io/2009/01/11/top-40/</link>

&lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/2.0/80x15.png&#34; alt=&#34;Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 2.0 Generic License&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/people/ger-audrey/&#34;&gt; Ger Audrey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imagecodr.org/&#34;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved the &lt;em&gt;think top 40&lt;/em&gt; part of &lt;a href=&#34;http://alextangofuego.blogspot.com/2008/11/i-couldnt-bear-to-watch-check-your.html&#34;&gt;Alex&amp;rsquo; rant&lt;/a&gt; after attending a festival. The dj should think hits, hits and more hits to please the dancers. And maybe throw in a little surprise. Not all the time, but we need a little variation. But in general, play the good stuff. People are not interested in you digging up some weird music that you think &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; will work for tango. We know what works for tango. It&amp;rsquo;s not that hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tango works for tango.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we need some variation, but it should all be good, danceable &lt;strong&gt;tango music&lt;/strong&gt;. And another connotation of top 40 is that the tango was broadly speaking at the top in the forties. So it is excellent advice for the tango dj.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people seem to think they should select music among the top 40 charts of today, but that music is not made for dancing tango to, and  - well it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. It seems to have been established as some kind of rule that &amp;ldquo;alternative&amp;rdquo; music may be played at the end of the night? Why would that be, to make me go home early? Tango music seems to be something of an aquired taste, and generally many beginners like the &amp;ldquo;alternative tango music&amp;rdquo; which should rather be labeled non-tango music. Which is ok of course, in a non-milonga environment. Beginners come early and leave early. Why play the trash in the end of the night?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of lack of finesse&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s with the watching the floor all the time, checking the floor before each step, head moving from side to side, constantly, as if chasing cucarachas. I did not come up with this description myself, but it is very fitting, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoever came up with this new &amp;lsquo;style&amp;rsquo; (or rather lack thereof)? Somebody near them should tell them that it looks ridiculous. And please stop doing it. It is just plain wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/index.php/2008/11/16/shut-up-and-listen/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; got me going on the habit that some dancers have of &lt;em&gt;talking while dancing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just stop it, ok?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can you possibly be listening to the music when you are talking at the same time? The conversation is going on in the dance, remember? And even if you somehow manage to do both at the same time, you are disturbing the others on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Salón Canning</title>

&lt;p&gt;I realize that the guys at Movement invites movement are not afraid of provocation, but I think they suffer a tiny bit from a syndrome often associated with Gringos, shooting from the waist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their &lt;a href=&#34;http://movementinvitesmovement.wordpress.com/2008/10/28/gringo-milongas/&#34;&gt;rant abot Canning&lt;/a&gt;,  they fail to recognize a few important reasons Canning has such an important position. Aside from being one of the very best floors in the city (maybe &lt;em&gt;the very best&lt;/em&gt;), it attracts many excellent dancers. Both local and visitors. Both traditional and nuevo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also happens to be the one milonga that stayed open during the dirty war when tango dancing in effect was prohibited in Argentina. This is probably part of the reason why it is indeed the &lt;em&gt;famous&lt;/em&gt; Canning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I believe &lt;a href=&#34;http://parakultural.com.ar/&#34;&gt;Parakultural&lt;/a&gt;, the organizer on Mondays and Fridays was one of the first in the revival of tango 10-15 years ago, and this is why these days are among the most popular at Canning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, Parakultural may be a victim of its own success, and the most busy hours, it can be practically impossible to get around the dance floor. It only takes one couple to ruin the flow of an entire floor, and when the floor is packed, well, you get stuck. It usually gets better later in the night after most of the turistas go home ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, for us who enjoy walking and good rotation on the dance floor, the milongas out of the centre may be a better alternative. Sigh. If only I were there too&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
