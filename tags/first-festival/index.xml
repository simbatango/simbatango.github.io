      <description>&amp;ndash;So&amp;hellip; what are these guys up to? There I was, attending my very first tango festival.Â I did not know very much about tango, but I did know enough to notice this couple. They were dancing, but they were doing something quite different&amp;hellip; Different indeed. Yet there was something tangoish over it. Not quite ballroom tango, not quite Argentine tango, still a hint of tango.
Only watching Saturday Night Fever probably years later, did I realize: What they had been doing was the tango hustle.</description>
