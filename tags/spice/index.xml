&lt;p&gt;It is common to say that we taste four diffent tastes: sweet, salt, bitter and sour. Combinations of these make up all other tastes. Sounds familiar? You may be guessing what I&amp;rsquo;m getting at&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience of taste, or should I say the experience of a meal, which we humans make for the pure pleasure of enjoying the different tastes and combinations, consists of &lt;strong&gt;a lot more&lt;/strong&gt; than these four basic tastes (some also include umami, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the point).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the four basic tastes, the &lt;strong&gt;consistency&lt;/strong&gt; of what we eat obviously makes quite a difference, porridge and beef are quite different in this respect, spaghetti needs to be &lt;em&gt;al dente&lt;/em&gt;. Whether it is hot or cold,  hard or soft, wet or dry&amp;hellip; The list goes on and on. We also have &lt;strong&gt;pain&lt;/strong&gt; receptors in the mouth, which respond to things like chili, adding the spicy sting that the Argentines do not seem to enjoy very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;smell&lt;/strong&gt;s are also very important. This is a point frequently made by the wine connoisseurs, much of what we consider taste, is actually smell, try to enjoy a nice vintage while your nose is blocked by a cold&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presentation&lt;/strong&gt;, or the visual aspect of food also makes quite a difference. No surprise that the finest cuisines make a lot of effort in presenting their food as delicately and elegantly as possible, balancing colour, volumes and textures for the best possible visual experience in addition to the tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the &lt;strong&gt;ambience&lt;/strong&gt; or context of the meal also adds a lot (or reduces, depending on the circumstances). Sitting alone in a nice restaurant does not create the same feelings for the food as sharing it with good friends in a nice environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably guessed already, the same goes for tango. What makes up a good dance, or a good night depends on a lot of factors, and we need to add some spice to the dance to keep it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t dance all porridge, add some spice to your dance. And make sure to savor &lt;strong&gt;everything it has to offer&lt;/strong&gt;. Why not explore some new flavours the next time you go out dancing?&lt;/p&gt;
