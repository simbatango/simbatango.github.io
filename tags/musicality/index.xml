&lt;p&gt;Not much time to write at the moment, here are some interesting posts that you might enjoy that I want to keep track of for later for my own sake:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;interesting-interview-with-chicho&#34;&gt;Interesting interview with Chicho&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.2xtango.com/mariano-chicho-frumboli-tengo-una-pregunta-para-vos-parte-1/&#34;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.2xtango.com/mariano-chicho-frumboli-tengo-una-pregunta-para-vos-parte-2/&#34;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.2xtango.com/mariano-chicho-frumboli-tengo-una-pregunta-para-vos-parte-3/&#34;&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite an interesting read. I could relate very well to his comments on why teachers don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily dance all the time at festivals. Apparently many people in my local community have difficulties understanding this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;listening-to-music-with-professor-craig-wright&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listening to Music&lt;/strong&gt; with Professor Craig Wright&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This course fosters the development of aural skills that lead to an understanding of Western music. The musical novice is introduced to the ways in which music is put together and is taught how to listen to a wide variety of musical styles, from Bach and Mozart, to Gregorian chant, to the blues.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://oyc.yale.edu/yale/music/listening-to-music&#34;&gt;Yale Open course website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen very few women dancing the man&amp;rsquo;s part where it does not look funny, this however is &lt;a href=&#34;http://enlamilonga.blogspot.com/2011/11/leccion-de-tango-de-dos-mujeres.html&#34;&gt;an impressive exception&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mickey Mousing</title>
      <link>http://simbatango.com/2010/06/02/mickey-mousing/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mickey.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mickey.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to be spreading, a new way of interpreting music in tango. Every so often I hear people rave about some couple&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;outstanding musicality&lt;/em&gt; and more often than not it translates to their mimicking every little plink and plonk in the music with a corresponding movement.  Naturally, it requires good knowledge of the song to do this, but does it really demonstrate such great musicality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once heard this way of dancing called &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mousing&#34;&gt;Mickey Mousing&lt;/a&gt;, as it was like this music was often used in animations, many from the 1930s and the 1940s. Except, of course the musicians put on the music to follow the cartoons, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to note that the wikipedia page says: &amp;ldquo;Frequently used in the 1930s and 1940s, especially by Max Steiner, it is somewhat discredited today, at least in serious films, because of overuse.&amp;rdquo; As this thechnique was much used at the prime time of tango, it is also interesting to see that this overuse was pointed out already in the 1940s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For some reason, many cartoon musicians are more concerned with exact synchronization or &#34;mickey-mousing&#34; than with the originality of their contribution or the variety of their arrangement. To be sure, many of the cartoons as they reach the musician are something less than inspirational, but most of them even the best, gain less than they should from this contribution.

&gt; 
&gt; _[Hollywood Quarterly, Vol 1, No 4 (Jul. 1946), p 365](http://www.jstor.org/pss/1209496)_
&gt; 
&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less inspirational, indeed. While I do find for instance Chicho&amp;rsquo;s dance extremely musical at its best, there are &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2010/01/22/what-does-it-mean-to-dance-with-good-musicality/&#34;&gt;so many aspects of music and musicality&lt;/a&gt;, that going mainly for the Mickey Mousing is somehow one-dimentional, and when other people try to repeat Chicho&amp;rsquo;s feat, it easily gets totally uninteresting, at least to me. At times I also get the feeling that the dancers are &amp;lsquo;too clever&amp;rsquo;, and not conveying any emotional content corresponding with the music I hear. It was thrilling the first time, maybe, but it is an effect that should be used with care, like all effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to argue that someone else&amp;rsquo;s musical interpretation is &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/strong&gt;, but if it differs too much from your own, it is hard to connect to what they are doing. It gets distracting, and it feels like they are not even listening to the music, which is ironic when in this particular case they are working so hard to match it perfectly. That goes for performances as well as social dancing. Instead of chasing the music, trying to match every instant of it, let go and wait. Let the music move you, then take control and make it yours. Don&amp;rsquo;t rush it. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you miss a plink. It&amp;rsquo;s your dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make an impact, be it with the audience or with our partner, we need to share a common understanding of the music, finding its substance together. All the effects in the world cannot compensate for a lack of substance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Music Instinct</title>
      <link>http://simbatango.com/2010/04/18/the-music-instinct/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/music-instinct.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://simbatango.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/music-instinct.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know more about music than you think. You start picking up the rules from the day you are born, yes even before. And part of what makes music enjoyable is this knowledge of what to expect and the delight when your expectations are fulfilled, or some times bent a little before they find resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of the message of a fascinating book about music, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Music-Instinct-Works-Cant-without/dp/1847920888/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1271619437&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;The Music Instinct&lt;/a&gt; by Philip Ball, (read reviews for instance in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15450498&#34;&gt;The Economist&lt;/a&gt;, or in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/feb/21/the-music-instinct-philip-ball&#34;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;) a book that I finally had time to finish reading this week-end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philip Ball has reviewed a lot of research on how our brains process music, and combines that knowledge with music theory and research in a very interesting blend. I enjoyed it a lot, and there is clearly material for quite a few posts here, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the time to process it all yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already as small children we have figured out a lot of  the rules of music, but mainly about the music with which we are familiar. Ball investigates what is universal and what is based on cultural habit, how we interpret pitch, scales, melody, harmony,  rhythm, syntactic rules, semantics, the list goes on and on. In the final chapter he among other things discusses whether music can be interpreted incorrectly  &amp;ndash; fascinating topics and very relevant to tango as to all other music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recommended read, and I&amp;rsquo;ll certainly get back to this later. Did you know that even an amoeba can respond to rhythm? Seems unlikely tango beginners could lack that ability&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tango dancers often discuss the importance of dancing to the music, having &amp;lsquo;good musicality&amp;rsquo; etc.  But what exactly does it mean to dance musically? I tried noting some possibilities, and since some are very basic, while other are more advanced (and should be used sparingly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to classify them within the usual trichotomy of beginner/intermediate/advanced, thinking that you have to know the very basics, and you should master basically everything in the intermediate before venturing out into the advanced concepts. Some of the advanced concepts should be used with care, such as stepping on the weak beat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;very-basics&#34;&gt;Very basics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dancing when there is music and not when there is not (yes, really)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stepping on the (strong)beat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make your partner step on the (strong) beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(be able to)Dance double time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make pauses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dance tango to tango music, milonga to milonga and vals to vals (etc)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;intermediate&#34;&gt;Intermediate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation of the emotional content of the music (e.g. humorous, sad, tragic, romantic etc)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walk to music with strong walking beat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dance to the phrasing of the music&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dancing the pauses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dance smoother to smooth music, more rhythmically to rhythmic music etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading one rhythm while doing another&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Match something in the music with particular step or ornament&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dance the final variation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predict the end of a song and close in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cadencia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;advanced&#34;&gt;Advanced&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step on the weak beat (and not on the strong)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving counter to the music (e.g. slow down when the music is fast)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Play with rhythms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fit sequences of steps with the phrases of the music&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeat and make variations when the music repeats with variations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syncopated steps (e.g. suspension or anticipation) that fits the music&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something extra :-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>The structure of a tango, choreography and how it might improve your dancing</title>

&lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/2.0/80x15.png&#34; alt=&#34;Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic License&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/people/aperte/&#34;&gt; aperte&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imagecodr.org/&#34;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you prefer your naïve, pure emotional interpretation of the tango, you might not want to read this. If, on the other hand you think that knowing a little about how tango music is organized might increase the breadth or depth of your musical appreciation, then this could be for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&#34;http://tangocommuter1.blogspot.com/2009/08/three-minute-question.html&#34;&gt;Tangocommuter writes&lt;/a&gt; in the discussion of how a tango became approximately three minutes long, a prototypical tango has the structure ABA:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Most tangos, and most songs generally, are A-B-A in structure. It&#39;s a structure people seem to like, it works well musically and in a song. 16-bar blues follow much the same pattern. In practice, we get three segments of around 16 bars each. 16 bars to a minute, mas o menos, 48 bars start to finish. 48 bars of four beats each, that&#39;s 192 beats in three minutes, which is... 64 beats a minute. A familiar number. 192 heart beats to a tango.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best example to look for in my knowledge is the orchestra of Carlos Di Sarli, which adhered fairly strictly to a regular scheme for all his tangos.  A musician I met in Buenos Aires told me that Di Sarli was known as the master of something I think he called the quadratic form or something similar. The 16 bars (or measures as they are often called) can again be divided into four phrases of 4 bars of two strong and two weak beats each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what is more interesting than this little arithmetic is that these 4 sections of 4 bars form a structure of theme and variations inside the main structure of the tango. Gustavo Naveira called this &amp;lsquo;call&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;response&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;question&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;answer&amp;rsquo;, I don&amp;rsquo;t recall exactly. My musician friend objected to this and called them variations.  Whatever you want to call it, it is there, and you can hear it and use it in your dancing if you like. With the second being a response to the first and the fourth being a response to the third, there is also some sort of nested structure of dialogue between the first two phrases and the two last. Very neat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, creating a choreography is an art in itself, and sadly there are very few that master this art &amp;lsquo;a full&amp;rsquo;, as they would say in Buenos Aires. Taking this structural knowledge into the choreography would be a good framework to build a choreography around, one would imagine. In my own attempts to do semi choreography dances, matching the main turning points of the music was always a major concern, and that is why I find it so surprising (and disappointing) that so many performances seem to pay no attention at all to the general structure of the song they are performing to. Not even the main structure of main theme (A or AA), the contrasting theme (B) and the final variation (A again). I mean, not even reflecting the development from beginning to end. Just unmotivated throwing out of crowd pleasing steps in all directions from the start. I don&amp;rsquo;t get it. It is soooo boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this seems to be a disease which is prominent with the followers of the maestro that first taught me about this in a dance context. I find it somewhat ironic that the dancers most concerned with the &amp;lsquo;structure of tango&amp;rsquo; (the dance) seem to overlook completely the structure of tango (the music). Maybe it will come later in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2009/01/16/reinvention/&#34;&gt;reinvention&lt;/a&gt; project?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we are not doing choreography, you may protest. True, but still you have to listen to the music, and knowing just a little about what to listen for, might improve your listening (and thus dancing) experience. One gringo that was also taking the same seminar with Naveira found that part of the class utterly uninteresting  &amp;ndash; clearly you can already hear this, he said. Which is sort of true for many dancers, on the other hand, watching many people dance, one has to wonder&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I do not suggest that you start counting over and over again while you are out at the milongas dancing with your friends and strangers in the night, far from it. However, it can be useful to listen carefully for the specific developments of the music during one tango and try dancing to it. It should come as no surprise that a large number of step combinations taught are actually matching exactly one phrase in tango (8 strong beats or four measures/bars). Try it with the normal basic step if you still remember it&amp;hellip; Also it can be useful to try combining walking exercises (which you still do regularly, no?) with phrasing exercises. For example doing one kind of adornos for one full phrase. No less and no longer. Exactly one phrase. I suggest you try with Di Sarli, pick any song basically, as he conforms fairly closely to this scheme. We have good experience with walking our student through these exercises, even without much explanation, as moving with the phrases gives an intuitive understanding of the music, which you will eventually bring to the dance floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jorge Dispari talked about how people &lt;a href=&#34;http://simbatango.com/2009/05/10/on-circulation/&#34;&gt;used to interpret the music in a more similar fashion&lt;/a&gt; in the golden age of tango, I suspect this might be part of what he was talking about (the A(A)BA structure). I everyone is saving their giros and extra stuff for the final variation, then everybody stops progressing at the same time, and nobody gets hurt.. Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to take his music seminar, so this remains my theory or speculations if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, comments and corrections from more knowledgeable readers are most welcome&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;You see, that is not the way to make it &amp;lsquo;swing&amp;rsquo; in tango.&lt;/em&gt; I was looking out onto the group of people standing around us with question marks painted all over their faces. &amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;Well, I don&amp;rsquo;t know the right word, but the corresponding to swing in tango.&lt;/em&gt; They were bouncing up and down for each step, like in many other dances; swing and folk dance were probably what they had been somewhat exposed to before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&amp;ndash;You make it swing by changing the weight, but staying in the same level. _I explained and demonstrated, knowing it was really a crude simplification. It was not the time to start talking of phrasing and movements of upper body, but I think they got the idea. The caricature of what they were doing made them smile&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what would be a good word for it? Cadencia? Canyengue? Tango? &lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;You see, to make it &lt;strong&gt;tango&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; Nah..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been said about tango that your feet dance the rhythm, while your body dances the melody. Which is well put, I think. It is fascinating this constrast between the hastily moving, intertwining legs, playing games while the upper bodies are calm in a loving embrace. This contrast is essential to the dance&amp;rsquo;s almost hypnotical attraction on the spectators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing the dancers flowing around the dance floor, the music arriving in waves. And the dancers surfing on these waves. Breathing with the phrases Doing their thing. Not rushing it. Not controlled by it, but somehow following it nevertheless. While the feet go ric-tic-tic-tic-tic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is the essence of the cadencia, I think. This flowing motion of the bodies. Waves, pendulums. Rising and falling. Apparently cadencia comes from Latin and means fall, so I could be on to something here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With many foreign dancers (like myself), the dance will appear and feel a little stiff (duro) or flat (chato). A perfomance can be very good in the sense that it is well coordinated, dancers always in balance, synchonized and moving to the right place in every step. Flawless. Still there will be something missing. And what is missing, I believe often to be the cadencia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once did a variant of a simple backstep that I learned from a milonguero with a friend at a practica. She looked at me, horrified, and said: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ndash;It felt almost like we were falling.&lt;/em&gt; Well, that was the point&amp;hellip; Falling safely in my embrace. Feeling the cadencia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact one of the best compliments you could possibly get is to be told that you have cadencia by someone who knows what it&amp;rsquo;s about. Not that I suggest that I really know. Well, at least I am trying. And I write this despite the fact that it may be the proof that I will never get it, I have this sneaky feeling that it is with tango as it is with jazz. If you have to ask&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is good musicality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countless workshops are offered, people discuss who is dancing more musical or who doesn&amp;rsquo;t get it. But not easy to define. So without trying to get to the bottom of it, some reflexions are in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard quite often after dancing for a few years that I was dancing musically, which of course made me happy. Who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t like to dance musically? Of course it could be just to be polite and not mentioning my other more obvious shortcomings, but I think that even if my musicality was not very good or mature, at least I was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listening to the music&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stepping on the beat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be much, but when watching the dance floor in many places, a lot of people actually do neither. Which I find very strange, and explains why it is possible to stand out only by having the basics covered. Why people go dancing year after year without listening to the music, however, is simply beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;
