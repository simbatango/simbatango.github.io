      <description>When I heard about the Dinzel book, I thought it was sort of a curious project. Working through all possibilities of tango steps, charting them out in elaborate diagrams with circles and arrows in all directions demonstrating the vast space of choreographic possibilites. I had a look at the book at a friend&amp;rsquo;s place several years ago, but it felt somehow disconnected to how I experienced the dance.</description>

   [T]oday there is a new generation that learned to dance 2,3 or 5 years ago, who only know how to do the new styles, the ganchos, the colgadas, but who are not in contact with everything that came before, and I go to the milongas and I see people that know how to move but that don’t know how to dance, people don’t breathe tango like they did before.</description>

-Have you been practicing tango nuevo? Guilty as charged.
He knew immediately. And it was not because I used an open embrace, we were practicing milonga, using a very confined embrace.
I often wonder why people get so hang up on the somewhat arbitrary distinction between open and close embrace (all teachers, both &amp;ldquo;nuevo&amp;rdquo; and others usually promote very close embrace at times, but for some figures it is not possible to maintain the closest embrace.</description>

After discussing my short post on reinvention in the comments, I decided to write a new post discussing the matter. Here is the quote again:
&#34;Those who don&#39;t understand [Tango] are condemned to reinvent it, poorly.&#34;   – Henry Spencer (about Unix)      First I thought of it as a warning against setting out to reinvent or improve something that you do not fully understand, as it will be futile.</description>

&#34;Those who don&#39;t understand [Tango] are condemned to reinvent it, poorly.&#34;   – Henry Spencer (about Unix)    I believe Miguel Angel Zotto to have said something along the same lines, that if you do not understand tango, how can you possibly improve it? I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to find the reference, though.</description>
