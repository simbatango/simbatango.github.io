Dear readers: I need your advice: We consider ourselves to find our way around in Buenos Aires fairly well after several previous stays there. This time, however, there is something different. We are no longer a couple going to the milongas every night. We are a small family.
Strolling with or without purpose in the streets of our beloved city we can still do, enjoying café con leche while watching people walk past, too.</description>
