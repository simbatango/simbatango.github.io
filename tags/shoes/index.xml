      <description>I got the shoe factory P.H. recommended from several reliable sources, unfortunately I got the directions a little late, so we&amp;rsquo;ll see if I make it in time. Anyway, as a reference for next visit, here it is:
Grito de Asencio 3602, Pompeya - Buenos Aires
Tel/Fax: 4911-0295
The colectivo (bus) 160 goes there, according to the owner of the shoes in the bag above.

      <description>Guess what was in the mailbox for our little son the other day? A nice pair of &amp;lsquo;shoes&amp;rsquo; made by a friend back home. She has specialized in this kind of baby footwear perfect for developing small feet and new walking skills.
All hand made, she makes an effort in always finding a new twist, theming them with butterflies, elephants or monsters. Or creating the very first tango shoes for a tangobaby.</description>

Sure he was great, but don&#39;t forget that Ginger Rogers did everything he did, backwards... and in high heels. I had the pleasure of dancing with a woman in Buenos Aires who really knew how to operate her feet. She worked in television in her country, and was known as &amp;rsquo;the woman that knows how to walk on high heels&amp;rsquo;.</description>

What I do understand: People (men and women) are crazy about these shoes. They look (and are) extremely sharp, sexy, are light and well balanced. In other words perfect for dancing. An image of exclusivity also helps, although it has faded a little the last few years.
What I don&amp;rsquo;t understand: Why the competition hasn&amp;rsquo;t caught up. It surely can&amp;rsquo;t be that hard? After all, we are not talking rocket science.</description>
